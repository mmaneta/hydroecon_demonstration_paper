                   in the time series of measured precipitation and
                   snowfall over the United States and Canada are
                   discussed and analyzed. The spatial statistical
                   characteristics of monthly and annual snowfall and
                   total precipitation are investigated and
                   parameterized. After adjustments and selection of the
                   “best” network, reliable “first guess”
                   estimates of North American snowfall and
                   precipitation are obtained. Century-long time series

                   the south of 55°N and 40-year time series of
                   unbiased area-averaged annual precipitation and
                   snowfall for all of North America are developed. The
                   analysis of their trends shows the following. 1)
                   During the last 100 years, annual precipitation has
                   increased in southern Canada (south of 55°N) by
                   13{\%} and in the contiguous United States by 4{\%};
                   however, the main domain of this century-scale
                   precipitation increase is eastern Canada and adjacent
                   to it northern regions of the United States. 2) U...},

                   indicator, independent of traditional drought
                   indicators based on in situ monitoring. GRACE shows
                   depletion in TWS of 62.3 ± 17.7 km 3 during the 2011
                   drought. Large uncertainties in simulated soil
                   moisture storage depletion (14–83 km 3) from six
                   land surface models indicate that GRACE TWS is a more
                   reliable drought indicator than disaggregated soil
                   moisture or groundwater storage. Groundwater use and
                   groundwater level data indicate that depletion is
                   dominated by changes in soil moisture storage,
                   consistent with high correlation between GRACE TWS
                   and the Palmer Drought Severity Index. GRACE provides
                   a valuable tool for monitoring statewide water

                   Canadian agriculture have become an important
                   research field since the early 1980s. In this paper,
                   we seek to synthesize this research, focusing on
                   agricultural adaptation, a purposeful proactive or
                   reactive response to changes associated with climate,
                   and influenced by many factors. A distinctive feature
                   of methods used in research on adaptation in Canadian
                   agriculture is the focus on the important role of
                   human agency. Many individual farmers perceive they
                   are well adapted to climate, because of their
                   extensive 'technological' tool-kit, giving them
                   confidence in dealing with climatic change. In many
                   regions, little concern is expressed over climatic
                   change, except where there are particular types of
                   climatic vulnerability. Farmers respond to
                   biophysical factors, including climate, as they
                   interact with a complex of human factors. Several of
                   these, notably institutional and political ones, have
                   tended to diminish the farm-level risks stemming from
                   climatic variability and change, but may well
                   increase the long term vulnerability of Canadian
                   agriculture. Notwithstanding the technological and
                   management adaptation measures available to
                   producers, Canadian agriculture remains vulnerable to
                   climatic variability and to climate change.},

  abstract =      {Global climate change impacts are already tracked in
                   many physical and biological systems and they reveal
                   a consistent picture of changes, e.g. an earlier
                   onset of spring events in mid and higher latitudes
                   and a lengthening of the plant growing season.
                   However, available results are mainly based on the
                   study of wild plants, whereas only a few studies have
                   hinted at an earlier spring onset for agricultural
                   plants. So far, no comprehensive study has compared
                   phenological shifts between agricultural crops, fruit
                   trees and wild plants. We analysed phenological time
                   series of 93 phases in Germany (1951-2004) employing
                   Bayesian nonparametric function estimation, and found
                   that events related to the production of annual crops
                   clearly differ from spring and summer events in wild
                   plants and fruit trees. While non-farmer driven
                   agricultural events and spring and summer growth
                   stages of wild plants and fruit trees advanced (i.e.
                   occurred earlier) by 4.4 to 7.1 d decade(-1), farming
                   indicators, such as sowing and subsequent emergence
                   of spring and winter crops, as well as harvesting,
                   advanced by only 2.1 d decade(-1). The estimated
                   functional behaviour and emergence of discontinuous
                   changes are clearly different between the 2 groups.
                   We conclude that phenological responses to
                   temperature changes are only reflected in data of
                   wild plants, fruit trees and those spring growth
                   stages of winter crops and later growth stages of
                   spring crops which are exclusively triggered by
                   climate, while other changes due to agricultural
                   production are subject to management practice
                   alterations.},

                   potential impacts of climate change on future
                   agricultural productivity and to examine options for
                   adaptation by local stakeholders and policy makers.
                   However, protocols followed in such assessments vary
                   to such an extent that they constrain cross-study
                   syntheses and increase the potential for bias in
                   projected impacts. We reviewed 221 peer-reviewed
                   papers that used crop simulation models to examine
                   diverse aspects of how climate change might affect
                   agricultural systems. Six subject areas were
                   examined: target crops and regions; the crop model(s)
                   used and their characteristics; sources and
                   application of data on [CO2] and climate; impact
                   parameters evaluated; assessment of variability or
                   risk; and adaptation strategies. Wheat, maize,
                   soybean and rice were considered in approximately 170
                   papers. The USA (55 papers) and Europe (64 papers)
                   were the dominant regions studied. The most frequent
                   approach used to simulate response to CO2 involved
                   adjusting daily radiation use efficiency (RUE) and
                   transpiration, precluding consideration of the
                   interacting effects of CO2, stomatal conductance and
                   canopy temperature, which are expected to exacerbate
                   effects of global warming. The assumed baseline [CO2]
                   typically corresponded to conditions 10–30 years
                   earlier than the date the paper was accepted,
                   exaggerating the relative impacts of increased [CO2].
                   Due in part to the diverse scenarios for increases in
                   greenhouse gas emissions, assumed future [CO2] also
                   varied greatly, further complicating comparisons
                   among studies. Papers considering adaptation
                   predominantly examined changes in planting dates and
                   cultivars; only 20 papers tested different tillage
                   practices or crop rotations. Risk was quantified in
                   over half the papers, mainly in relation to
                   variability in yield or effects of water deficits,
                   but the limited consideration of other factors
                   affecting risk beside climate change per se suggests
                   that impacts of climate change were overestimated
                   relative to background variability. A coordinated
                   crop, climate and soil data resource would allow
                   researchers to focus on underlying science. More
                   extensive model intercomparison, facilitated by
                   modular software, should strengthen the biological
                   realism of predictions and clarify the limits of our
                   ability to forecast agricultural impacts of climate
                   change on crop production and associated food
                   security as well as to evaluate potential for

                   Basin, Brazil. It then uses a basin-wide economic
                   model of agriculture to examine the effects of
                   implementing water use regulations. Preliminary
                   results suggest that substantially expanding
                   agriculture would put pressure on some of the river's
                   environmental flows. Agricultural output and rural
                   employment would increase, though not in spatially

                   cropping area, crop mix and production technology

                   be optimized to maximize farmers' yearly net

                   substitution (CES) production function simulating
                   agricultural production. The hydrologic component is
                   a detailed physics-based three-dimensional
                   hydrodynamic model that simulates changes in the
                   hydrologic system derived from agricultural activity
                   while in turn providing biophysical constraints to
                   the economic system. The linked models capture the
                   effects of the interactions between the hydrologic
                   and the economic systems at high spatial and temporal
                   resolutions, ensuring that the model converges to an

                   minimize their effects on farm profits, and that the

  abstract =      {Droughts are a persistent and costly hazard impacting
                   human and environmental systems. As climate
                   variability continues to increase and socioeconomic
                   development influences the distribution of wealth and
                   people, drought risk is expected to increase in many
                   parts of the world. The unique characteristics of
                   droughts—namely their slow onset, large
                   spatiotemporal extent, human-influenced propagation,
                   delayed impacts and teleconnection potential—make
                   it difficult to correctly assess drought impact and
                   calculate risk. Further complicating this calculation
                   is the capacity for humans to make adaptive decisions
                   before, during, and after a drought event, which in
                   turn alters expected impacts. In this sense, droughts
                   are equally a social and hydroclimatic issue. Risk
                   perception is one of the main factors driving
                   adaptation decisions, yet most models neglect how
                   humans view and respond to risk, and in particular
                   how experiences influence decisions through time. In
                   this overview, we describe a framework that extends
                   the traditional risk modeling approach to include the
                   two-way feedback between the transient adaptation
                   decisions and drought exposure, vulnerability and
                   hazard. We discuss how a sociohydrologic, agent-based
                   modeling setup, focused on individual and collective
                   actions, can simulate the adaptive behaviors of
                   different stakeholders to examine how emergent
                   actions might influence projected drought risk. We
                   suggest such an approach can provide a test-bed for
                   understanding adaptive behaviors in an increasingly
                   drought-prone world and could allow for better
                   prioritization of drought adaptation strategies;
                   refined understanding of future scenarios; and a
                   vehicle to drive planning and resilience building.

                   banks are a marketing instrument that can address
                   these obstacles to trade, allowing irrigators within
                   a region to exchange water in order to mitigate the
                   short-term effects of drought. Water banks coexist
                   with the institu- tions governing water allocation,
                   which implies that rule changes, such as adoption of
                   a system of conjunc- tive surface water-groundwater
                   administration, carry implications for the economic
                   impacts of banking. This paper assesses and compares
                   the welfare and distributional outcomes for
                   irrigators in the Eastern Snake River Plain of Idaho
                   under a suite of water management and drought
                   scenarios. We find that water banking can offset
                   irrigators' profit losses during drought, but that
                   its ability to do so depends on whether it facili-
                   tates trade across groundwater and surface water
                   users. With conjunctive administration, a bank
                   allowing trade by source realizes 22.23{\%} of the
                   maximum potential efficiency gains from trade during
                   a severe drought, while a bank that allows trade
                   across sources realizes 93.47{\%} of the maximum
                   potential gains. Dur- ing drought, conjunctive
                   administration redistributes welfare from groundwater
                   to surface water producers, but banking across
                   sources allows groundwater irrigators to recover
                   88.4{\%} of the profits lost from drought at a cost
                   of 2.2{\%} of the profit earned by surface water

                   choices on water policies needed for adaptation to
                   climate change. Hydro-economic modeling is a
                   state-of-the art approach that can be used to guide
                   the design and implementation of these policies in
                   basins. A major gap in developments of hydro-economic
                   modeling to date has been the weak integration of
                   physically-based representations of water sources and
                   uses such as the interaction between ground and
                   surface water resources, to inform complex basin
                   scale policy choices. This paper presents an
                   integrated hydro-economic modeling framework to
                   address this gap with application to an important and
                   complex river basin in Spain, the Jucar basin, for
                   the assessment of a range of climate change scenarios
                   and policy choices. Results indicate that in absence
                   of adequate policies protecting water resources and
                   natural ecosystems, water users will strategically
                   deplete reservoirs, aquifers and river flows for
                   short-term adaptation to climate change, disregarding
                   the impacts on the environment and future human
                   activities. These impacts can be addressed by
                   implementing sustainable management policies.
                   However, these policies could have disproportionate
                   costs for some stakeholders groups, and their
                   opposition may undermine attempts at sustainable
                   policy. These tradeoffs among water policy choices
                   are important guides to the design of policies aimed
                   at basin-wide adaptation to climate change.},

                   agent-based approach introduces interactions among
                   farmers about new technologies and market
                   opportunities, and includes the updating of forecast
                   expectations and uncertainties using Bayesian
                   inference. The model is applied to a
                   semi-hypothetical example case of farmers in the Salt
                   Creek Watershed in Central Illinois, and a

                   factors affecting farmers' decisions are crop prices,
                   production costs, and yields. The results also show
                   that different farmer behavioral profiles can lead to
                   different predictions of farmer decisions. The
                   farmers who are predicted to be more likely to adopt

                   farmers, are less risk averse, quick to adjust their
                   expectations, and slow to reduce their forecast
                   confidence. The decisions of farmers have direct
                   water quality consequences, especially those
                   pertaining to the adoption of the second-generation
                   biofuel crop, which are estimated to lead to

                   However, the application of current vegetation
                   productivity algorithms derived from global satellite
                   observations is generally too coarse to capture
                   cropland heterogeneity. The fusion of data from
                   different sensors can provide enhanced information
                   and overcome many of the limitations of individual
                   sensors. In thitables study, we estimate annual crop
                   yields for seven important crop types across Montana
                   in the continental USA from 2008–2015, including
                   alfalfa, barley, maize, peas, durum wheat, spring
                   wheat and winter wheat. We used a satellite
                   data-driven light use efficiency (LUE) model to
                   estimate gross primary productivity (GPP) over
                   croplands at 30-m spatial resolution and eight-day
                   time steps using a fused NDVI dataset constructed by
                   blending Landsat (5 or 7) and Terra MODIS reflectance
                   data. The fused 30-m NDVI record showed good
                   consistency with the original Landsat and MODIS data,
                   but provides better spatiotemporal delineations of
                   cropland vegetation growth. Crop yields were
                   estimated at 30-m resolution as the product of
                   estimated GPP accumulated over the growing season and
                   a crop-specific harvest index (HI GPP). The resulting
                   GPP estimates capture characteristic cropland
                   productivity patterns and seasonal variations, while
                   the estimated annual crop production results
                   correspond favorably with reported county-level crop
                   production data (r = 0.96, relative RMSE = 37.0{\%},

                   yields at a finer (field) scale was generally lower,
                   but still meaningful (r = 0.42, relative RMSE =
                   50.8{\%}, p {\textless} 0.05). Our methods and
                   results are suitable for operational applications of
                   crop yield monitoring at regional scales, suggesting

                   continental USA (CONUS). Similar overlapping enhanced
                   vegetation index (EVI) records from Landsat and MODIS
                   were used to generate a continuous 30-m 8-day fused
                   EVI and ET record extending from 2008 to 2017 over
                   CONUS croplands. The satellite-based ET estimates
                   were compared with tower based ET observations over
                   different crop types, and more traditional cropland
                   actual ET (AET) estimates derived from reference ET
                   and crop-specific coefficients. The new satellite
                   based 30-m cropland ET estimates (ET 30m )
                   corresponded favorably with both tower ET
                   observations (ET flux ; R 2 = 0.69, RMSE = 0.70 mm d
                   −1 , bias = 0.04 mm d −1 ) and the baseline
                   global MOD16A2 ET product (ET MOD16 ). The ET 30m
                   results also showed better performance against the ET
                   flux observations than ET MOD16 (R 2 = 0.54, RMSE =
                   0.82 mm d −1 ) or AET (R 2 = 0.52, RMSE = 2.47 mm d
                   −1 ) for monitoring CONUS croplands. The spatial
                   and temporal patterns of the ET 30m results show
                   enhanced delineation of agricultural water use,
                   including impacts from variable climate, cropland
                   area and diversity. The resulting ET 30m record is
                   suitable for operational applications promoting more

                   events over agricultural regions has motivated a
                   number of efforts to develop operational integrated
                   hydroeconomic models to guide adaptation and optimal
                   use of water. Once calibrated, these models are used
                   for water management and analysis assuming they
                   remain valid under future conditions. In this paper,
                   we present and demonstrate a methodology that permits
                   the recursive calibration of economic models of
                   agricultural production from noisy but frequently
                   available data. We use a standard economic
                   calibration approach, namely positive mathematical
                   programming, integrated in a data assimilation
                   algorithm based on the ensemble Kalman filter
                   equations to identify the economic model parameters.
                   A moving average kernel ensures that new and past
                   information on agricultural activity are blended
                   during the calibration process, avoiding loss of
                   information and overcalibration for the conditions of
                   a single year. A regularization constraint akin to
                   the standard Tikhonov regularization is included in
                   the filter to ensure its stability even in the
                   presence of parameters with low sensitivity to
                   observations. The results show that the
                   implementation of the PMP methodology within a data
                   assimilation framework based on the enKF equations is
                   an effective method to calibrate models of
                   agricultural production even with noisy information.
                   The recursive nature of the method incorporates new
                   information as an added value to the known previous
                   observations of agricultural activity without the
                   need to store historical information. The robustness
                   of the method opens the door to the use of new remote
                   sensing algorithms for operational water management.

                   changes in precipitation characteristics due to
                   climate change, therefore, are expected to have a
                   considerable effect on the hydrological regime of the
                   river Meuse. We focus on an important tributary of

                   The well-known hydrological model HBV is forced with
                   three high-resolution (0.088 degrees) regional
                   climate scenarios, each based on one of three
                   different IPCC CO2 emission scenarios: A1B, A2 and
                   B1. To represent the current climate, a reference
                   model run at the same resolution is used. Prior to
                   running the hydrological model, the biases in the
                   climate model output are investigated and corrected
                   for. Different approaches to correct the distributed
                   climate model output using single-site observations
                   are compared. Correcting the spatially averaged
                   temperature and precipitation is found to give the
                   best results, but still large differences exist
                   between observations and simulations. The bias
                   corrected data are then used to force HBV. Results
                   indicate a small increase in overall discharge,
                   especially for the B1 scenario during the beginning
                   of the 21st century. Towards the end of the century,
                   all scenarios show a decrease in summer discharge,
                   partially because of the diminished buffering effect
                   by the snow pack, and an increased discharge in
                   winter. It should be stressed, however, that we used
                   results from only one GCM (the only one available at
                   such a high resolution). It would be interesting to

                   the semi-distributed, conceptual model HBV-D has been
                   successfully applied to simulate discharge for
                   present climate conditions. Further, the expanded
                   downscaling method (EDS) was calibrated and applied
                   to observed global circulation fields in order to
                   produce local climate input data for HBV-D. Finally,
                   the coupled atmosphere-ocean model ECHAM4/OPYC3,
                   driven by a climate change scenario, provided
                   simulated global circulation patterns for application
                   with EDS. The regionalised scenario conditions then
                   served as input to HBV-D in order to investigate the
                   impact of global climate change on regional
                   hydrology. The results indicate that an obvious
                   increase in temperature is accompanied by a clear
                   tendency to reduced precipitation over the
                   investigated area for the next 100 years. These
                   conditions lead to a decrease in simulated mean
                   discharges of the Mulde. The study is considered to
                   be a contribution for regional impact studies on
                   global climate change. At the same time, it
                   demonstrates existing shortcomings and limitations of
                   current climate impact research. {\textcopyright}

                   1-km2 land surface ET dataset for the
                   109.03Millionkm2 global vegetated land areas at an
                   8-day interval. In this study, we have further
                   improved the ET algorithm in Mu et al. (2007a,
                   hereafter called old algorithm) by 1) simplifying the
                   calculation of vegetation cover fraction; 2)
                   calculating ET as the sum of daytime and nighttime
                   components; 3) adding soil heat flux calculation; 4)
                   improving estimates of stomatal conductance,
                   aerodynamic resistance and boundary layer resistance;
                   5) separating dry canopy surface from the wet; and 6)
                   dividing soil surface into saturated wet surface and
                   moist surface. We compared the improved algorithm
                   with the old one both globally and locally at 46 eddy
                   flux towers. The global annual total ET over the
                   vegetated land surface is 62.8×103km3, agrees very
                   well with other reported estimates of 65.5×103km3
                   over the terrestrial land surface, which is much
                   higher than 45.8×103km3 estimated with the old
                   algorithm. For ET evaluation at eddy flux towers, the
                   improved algorithm reduces mean absolute bias (MAE)
                   of daily ET from 0.39mm day−1 to 0.33mmday−1
                   driven by tower meteorological data, and from
                   0.40mmday−1 to 0.31mmday−1 driven by GMAO data, a
                   global meteorological reanalysis dataset. MAE values
                   by the improved ET algorithm are 24.6{\%} and
                   24.1{\%} of the ET measured from towers, within the
                   range (10–30{\%}) of the reported uncertainties in
                   ET measurements, implying an enhanced accuracy of the
                   improved algorithm. Compared to the old algorithm,
                   the improved algorithm increases the skill score with
                   tower-driven ET estimates from 0.50 to 0.55, and from
                   0.46 to 0.53 with GMAO-driven ET. Based on these
                   results, the improved ET algorithm has a better
                   performance in generating global ET data products,
                   providing critical information on global terrestrial
                   water and energy cycles and environmental changes.},

                   Flash Drought}},

  abstract =      {A rapidly developing "flash drought" occurred over
                   the US Northern Plains in the summer of 2017, spurred
                   by unusually high temperatures and strong evaporative
                   demand. The impacts of the drought included
                   widespread reductions in rangeland and agricultural
                   productivity that cascaded into significant economic
                   losses. Here, we used satellite information from the
                   NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission to
                   clarify the nature and impact of the drought on
                   regional vegetation growth. The model enhanced SMAP
                   Level 4 Soil Moisture (L4SM) and Carbon (L4C)
                   products were used with other ancillary data to
                   examine spatial and seasonal anomalies in surface to
                   root zone soil moisture and vegetation productivity
                   (GPP). We find that the flash drought was triggered
                   by a mid-July heat wave, conditioned by exceptionally
                   low spring rainfall. The drought resulted in
                   anomalous low soil moisture levels and regional GPP
                   collapse, coinciding with severe (D3) to exceptional
                   (D4) drought conditions indicated from the US Drought
                   Monitor. The SMAP L4C GPP anomalies closely tracked
                   reported county-level crop production anomalies for
                   the major regional crop types, indicating generally
                   larger productivity decline in managed croplands than
                   surrounding natural areas. The SMAP L4 global
                   products provide an effective indicator of vegetation
                   growth changes and moisture-related restrictions on
                   ecosystem productivity that are complementary with
                   more traditional drought assessment tools.},

                   farm modelling often results in overspecialised model
                   solutions. The positive mathematical programming
                   (PMP) approach guarantees exact calibration to base
                   year data but the forecasting capacity of the model
                   is affected by necessary but arbitrary assumptions
                   imposed during calibration. In this article, a new
                   PMP variant is presented which is based on less
                   arbitrary assumptions that, from a theoretical point
                   of view, are closer to the actual decision making of
                   the farmer. The PMP variant is evaluated according to
                   the predictions of the bio-economic farm model,
                   developed within the framework for integrated
                   assessment of agricultural systems in Europe
                   (SEAMLESS). The forecasting capacity of the model
                   calibrated with the standard PMP approach and the
                   alternative PMP variant, respectively, is tested in
                   ex-post experiments for the arable farm types of
                   Flevoland (the Netherlands) and Midi-Pyrenees
                   (France). The results of the ex-post experiments, in
                   which we try to simulate farm responses in 2003 using
                   a model calibrated to 1999 data, show that the
                   alternative PMP variant improves the forecasting
                   capacity of the model in all tested cases.},
