abstract = {Abstract Hydrologic records provide some of the most widespread, long-term data available that can be expected to contain signals of climate variation over time. Yet such data have not been used to identify the widespread effects of spring onset in the forested eastern United States, where streamflow is strongly influenced by vegetation. Three independent runoff characteristics are affected by the enhanced evapotranspiration (ET) that occurs with annual leaf emergence: (i) P − R, the difference between precipitation and runoff, returns to dormant season values and increases due to ET; (ii) the streamflow recession time constant (a measure of the time required after rainfall for streams to return to their baseflow levels) shortens; and (iii) the diurnal streamflow amplitude increases. The smallest watersheds in our dataset (area {\textless}200 km2) exhibit the diurnal streamflow signal most often and with the greatest amplitude, in accord with accepted relationships between channel length and watershed area.

abstract = {Western United States wildfire increases have been generally attributed to warming temperatures, either through effects on winter snowpack or summer evaporation. However, near-surface air temperature and evaporative demand are strongly influenced by moisture availability and these interactions and their role in regulating fire activity have never been fully explored. Here we show that previously unnoted declines in summer precipitation from 1979 to 2016 across 31-45{\%} of the forested areas in the western United States are strongly associated with burned area variations. The number of wetting rain days (WRD; days with precipitation ≥2.54 mm) during the fire season partially regulated the temperature and subsequent vapor pressure deficit (VPD) previously implicated as a primary driver of annual wildfire area burned. We use path analysis to decompose the relative influence of declining snowpack, rising temperatures, and declining precipitation on observed fire activity increases. After accounting for interactions, the net effect of WRD anomalies on wildfire area burned was more than 2.5 times greater than the net effect of VPD, and both the WRD and VPD effects were substantially greater than the influence of winter snowpack. These results suggest that precipitation during the fire season exerts the strongest control on burned area either directly through its wetting effects or indirectly through feedbacks to VPD. If these trends persist, decreases in summer precipitation and the associated summertime aridity increases would lead to more burned area across the western United States with far-reaching ecological and socioeconomic impacts.},

abstract = {IEEE The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission Level 4 Carbon (L4C) product provides model estimates of the Net Ecosystem CO {\&} {\#}x2082; exchange (NEE) incorporating SMAP soil moisture information. The L4C product includes NEE, computed as total ecosystem respiration less gross photosynthesis, at a daily time step posted to a 9-km global grid by plant functional type. Component carbon fluxes, surface soil organic carbon stocks, underlying environmental constraints, and detailed uncertainty metrics are also included. The L4C model is driven by the SMAP Level 4 Soil Moisture data assimilation product, with additional inputs from the Goddard Earth Observing System, Version 5 weather analysis, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite vegetation data. The L4C data record extends from March 31, 2015 to present with ongoing production and 8-12 day latency. Comparisons against concurrent global CO {\&} {\#}x2082; eddy flux tower measurements, satellite solar-induced canopy florescence, and other independent observation benchmarks show favorable L4C performance and accuracy, capturing the dynamic biosphere response to recent weather anomalies. Model experiments and L4C spatiotemporal variability were analyzed to understand the independent value of soil moisture and SMAP observations relative to other sources of input information. This analysis highlights the potential for microwave observations to inform models where soil moisture strongly controls land CO {\&} {\#}x2082; flux variability; however, skill improvement relative to flux towers is not yet discernable within the relatively short validation period. These results indicate that SMAP provides a unique and promising capability for monitoring the linked global terrestrial water and carbon cycles.},

abstract = {The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission is one of the first Earth observation satellites being developed by NASA in response to the National Research Council's Decadal Survey. SMAP will make global measurements of the soil moisture present at the Earth's land surface and will distinguish frozen from thawed land surfaces. Direct observations of soil moisture and freeze/thaw state from space will allow significantly improved estimates of water, energy, and carbon transfers between the land and the atmosphere. The accuracy of numerical models of the atmosphere used in weather prediction and climate projections are critically dependent on the correct characterization of these transfers. Soil moisture measurements are also directly applicable to flood assessment and drought monitoring. SMAP observations can help monitor these natural hazards, resulting in potentially great economic and social benefits. SMAP observations of soil moisture and freeze/thaw timing will also reduce a major uncertainty in quantifying the global carbon balance by helping to resolve an apparent missing carbon sink on land over the boreal latitudes. The SMAP mission concept will utilize L-band radar and radiometer instruments sharing a rotating 6-m mesh reflector antenna to provide high-resolution and high-accuracy global maps of soil moisture and freeze/thaw state every two to three days. In addition, the SMAP project will use these observations with advanced modeling and data assimilation to provide deeper root-zone soil moisture and net ecosystem exchange of carbon. SMAP is scheduled for launch in the 2014-2015 time frame.},

The daily sum of positive values of net radiation is used as an index of the snowmelt rate. Canopy cover is represented in terms of shortwave transmissivity and sky-view factor. The cases studied are a spruce forest in the Wolf Creek basin, Yukon Territory, Canada, and a pine forest near Fraser, Colorado. Of particular interest are the atmospheric conditions that favor an offset between shortwave energy attenuation and longwave irradiance enhancement by the canopy, such that net radiation does not decrease with increasing forest density. Such an offset is favored in dry climates and at high altitudes, where atmospheric emissivities are low, and in early spring when snow albedos are high and solar elevations are low. For low snow albedos, a steady decrease in snowmelt energy with increasing canopy cover is found, up to a forest density close to the actual densities of mat...},

Cascade spring snowpack declined 23{\%} during 1930–2007. This loss is nearly statistically significant at the 5{\%} level. The snowpack increased 19{\%} during the recent period of most rapid global warming (1976–2007), though this change is not statistically significant because of large annual variability.

abstract = {Many studies addressing climate change and climate variability over large regions rely on gridded data. Grids are preferred to station-based data sets because they help avoiding bias arising from the irregular spatial distribution of the observations. However, while spatial interpolation techniques used for constructing gridded data are good at preserving the mean of the data, they do not offer an adequate representation of their variance. In fact, the grid's variance depends largely on the spatial density of observations used for constructing it. Most global and regional climate data sets are characterized by large temporal changes in the number of observations available for interpolation, with a strong reduction in the last 30 years. These changes in the sample size result in changes in the variance of gridded data that are merely an effect of the interpolation process, and ignoring this fact may lead to erroneous conclusions about changes in climate variability and extremes. We discuss this problem and we demonstrate its importance with a widely used global dataset of temperature and precipitation. We propose to move from interpolation techniques towards statistical simulation approaches that provide a better representation of climate variability when constructing climatic grids.},

abstract = {Hydrologic models are twofold: models for understanding physical processes and models for prediction. This study addresses the latter, which modelers use to predict, for example, streamflow at some future time given knowledge of the current state of the system and model parameters. In this respect, good estimates of the parameters and state variables are needed to enable the model to generate accurate forecasts. In this paper, a dual state–parameter estimation approach is presented based on the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) for sequential estimation of both parameters and state variables of a hydrologic model. A systematic approach for identification of the perturbation factors used for ensemble generation and for selection of ensemble size is discussed. The dual EnKF methodology introduces a number of novel features: (1) both model states and parameters can be estimated simultaneously; (2) the algorithm is recursive and therefore does not require storage of all past information, as is the case in the batch calibration procedures; and (3) the various sources of uncertainties can be properly addressed, including input, output, and parameter uncertainties. The applicability and usefulness of the dual EnKF approach for ensemble streamflow forecasting is demonstrated using a conceptual rainfall-runoff model.},

Relative to GEOS-4, MERRA is generally warmer ({\~{}}0.5°C for Tmin and Tmax) and drier ({\~{}}50 Pa for VPD) for low- and middle-latitude regions ({\textless}50°N) associated with reduced cloudiness and increased SWrad. MERRA and AMSR-E temperatures show relatively large differences ({\textgreater}3°C) in mountainous areas, tropical forest, and desert regions. Surface soil moisture estimates from MERRA (0–2-cm depth) and two AMSR-E products ({\~{}}0–1-cm depth) are moderately correlated (R {\~{}} 0.4) for middle-latitude regions with low to moderate vegetation biomass. The MERRA derived surface soil moisture also corresponds favorably with in situ observations (R = 0.53 ± 0.01, p {\textless} 0.001) in the midlatitudes, where its accuracy is directly proportional to the quality of MERRA precipitation. In the high latitudes, MERRA shows inconsistent soil moisture seasonal dynamics relative to in situ observations. The study's results suggest that satellite microwave remote sensing may contribute to improved reanalysis accuracy where surface meteorological observations are sparse and in cold land regions subject to seasonal freeze–thaw transitions. The upcoming NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission is expected to improve MERRA-type reanalysis accuracy by providing accurate global mapping of freeze–thaw state and surface soil moisture with 2–3-day temporal fidelity and enhanced (≤9 km) spatial resolution},

abstract = {We review and qualitatively assess the importance of interactions and feedbacks in assessing climate change impacts on water and agriculture in Europe. We focus particularly on the impact of future hydrological changes on agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation and adaptation options. Future projected trends in European agriculture include northward movement of crop suitability zones and increasing crop productivity in Northern Europe, but declining productivity and suitability in Southern Europe. This may be accompanied by a widening of water resource differences between the North and South, and an increase in extreme rainfall events and droughts. Changes in future hydrology and water management practices will influence agricultural adaptation measures and alter the effectiveness of agricultural mitigation strategies. These interactions are often highly complex and influenced by a number of factors which are themselves influenced by climate. Mainly positive impacts may be anticipated for Northern Europe, where agricultural adaptation may be shaped by reduced vulnerability of production, increased water supply and reduced water demand. However, increasing flood hazards may present challenges for agriculture, and summer irrigation shortages may result from earlier spring runoff peaks in some regions. Conversely, the need for effective adaptation will be greatest in Southern Europe as a result of increased production vulnerability, reduced water supply and increased demands for irrigation. Increasing flood and drought risks will further contribute to the need for robust management practices. The impacts of future hydrological changes on agricultural mitigation in Europe will depend on the balance between changes in productivity and rates of decomposition and GHG emission, both of which depend on climatic, land and management factors. Small increases in European soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks per unit land area are anticipated considering changes in climate, management and land use, although an overall reduction in the total stock may result from a smaller agricultural land area. Adaptation in the water sector could potentially provide additional benefits to agricultural production such as reduced flood risk and increased drought resilience. The two main sources of uncertainty in climate impacts on European agriculture and water management are projections of future climate and their resulting impacts on water and agriculture. Since changes in climate, agricultural ecosystems and hydrometeorology depend on complex interactions between the atmosphere, biosphere and hydrological cycle there is a need for more integrated approaches to climate impacts assessments. Methods for assessing options which "moderate" the impact of agriculture in the wider sense will also need to consider cross-sectoral impacts and socio-economic aspects.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The recently launched Sentinel-1 satellite with a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensor onboard offers a powerful tool for irrigation monitoring under various weather conditions, with high spatial and temporal resolution. This research discusses the potential of different metrics calculated from the Sentinel-1 time series for mapping irrigated fields. A methodology for irrigation mapping using SAR data is proposed. The study is performed using VV (vertical–vertical) and VH (vertical–horizontal) polarizations over an agricultural site in Urgell, Catalunya (Spain). With field segmentation information from SIGPAC (the Geographic Information System for Agricultural Parcels), the backscatter intensities are averaged within each field. From the Sentinel-1 time series for each field, the statistics and metrics, including the mean value, the variance of the signal, the correlation length, and the fractal dimension, are analyzed. With the Support Vector Machine (SVM), the classification of irrigated crops, irrigated trees, and non-irrigated fields is performed with the metrics vector. The results derived from the SVM are validated with ground truthing from SIGPAC over the whole study area, with a good overall accuracy of 81.08{\%}. Random Forest (RF) machine classification is also tested in this study, which gives an accuracy of around 82.2{\%} when setting the tree depth at three. The methodology is based only on SAR data, which makes it applicable to all areas, even with frequent cloud cover, but this method may be less robust when irrigation is less dominated to soil moisture change.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Catchment systems are interestingly nonlinear, but their dynamics are constrained from being unduly chaotic by mass and energy balance requirements. There have been no attempts in hydrology that we know of that have tried to map both the flow and transport dynamics of a catchment in any form of phase space. In part, this is because of the high dimensionality of the space–time patterns of response; in part because there is sufficient uncertainty about the input and output fluxes estimated by measurement that this might be expected to obscure any attractor-like behaviour. In this study we explore the basin of the catchment attractor for the Multiple Interacting Pathway (MIPs) model that in previous papers has been shown to give good results for the small G{\aa}rdsj{\"{o}}n catchment in Sweden. MIPs is based on particle tracking techniques and gives results for both the flow responses and for the travel and residence time responses of water in the catchment. Here it is used to provide consistent values of fluxes, total storage, travel time distributions and residence time distributions for a long simulation period. The nature of those responses in storage and input dimensions is then investigated. The results suggest that the range of behaviours is hysteretic in interesting ways and constrained by the forcing inputs, with space filling of trajectories in the basin of attraction as should be expected of a forced dissipative system. The range of behaviours exhibited defines a space that the responses of any simpler emulator model will need to span. {\textcopyright} 2015 The Authors Hydrological Processes Published by John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

The results show that farmers react to rainfall shortages to minimize their effects on farm profits, and that the impact on farmers depends, among other things, on their location in the watershed and on their access to groundwater.},

abstract = {This paper synthesizes recent works at the interface of hydrology, geomorphology, and ecology under an integrated framework of analysis with an aim for a general theory. It addresses a wide range of related topics, including biodiversity of freshwater fish in river networks and vegetation along riparian systems, how river networks affected historic spreading of human populations, and how they influence the spreading of water-borne diseases. Given the commonalities among various dendritic structures and despite the variety and complexity of the ecosystems involved, we present here an integrated line of research addressing the above and related topics through a unique, coherent ecohydrological thread and similar mathematical methods. Metacommunity and individual-based models are studied in the context of hydrochory, population, and species migrations and the spreading of infections of water-borne diseases along the ecological corridors of river basins. A general theory emerges on the effects of dendritic geometries on the ecological processes and dynamics operating on river basins that will establish a new significant scientific branch. Insights provided by such a theory will lend themselves to issues of great practical importance such as integration of riparian systems into large-scale resource management, spatial strategies to minimize loss of freshwater biodiversity, and effective prevention campaigns against water-borne diseases.},

We find strong historical linkages between civil war and temperature in Africa, with warmer years leading to significant increases in the likelihood of war. When combined with climate model projections of future temperature trends, this historical response to temperature suggests a roughly 54{\%} increase in armed conflict incidence by 2030, or an additional 393,000 battle deaths if future wars are as deadly as recent wars. Our results suggest an urgent need to reform African governments' and foreign aid donors' policies to deal with rising temperatures.},

abstract = {Chloroplast RNA splicing 2 (CRS2) is a nuclear-encoded protein required for the splicing of nine group II introns in maize chloroplasts. CRS2 functions in the context of splicing complexes that include one of two CRS2-associated factors (CAF1 and CAF2). The CRS2-CAF1 and CRS2-CAF2 complexes are required for the splicing of different subsets of CRS2-dependent introns, and they bind tightly and specifically to their genetically defined intron targets in vivo. The CRS2 amino acid sequence is closely related to those of bacterial peptidyl-tRNA hydrolases (PTHs). To identify the structural differences between CRS2 and bacterial PTHs responsible for CRS2's gains of CAF binding and intron splicing functions, we determined the structure of CRS2 by X-ray crystallography. The fold of CRS2 is the same as that of Escherichia coli PTH, but CRS2 has two surfaces that differ from the corresponding surfaces in PTH. One of these is more hydrophobic in CRS2 than in PTH. Site-directed mutagenesis of this surface blocked CRS2-CAF complex formation, indicating that it is the CAF binding site. The CRS2 surface corresponding to the putative tRNA binding face of PTH is considerably more basic than in PTH, suggesting that CRS2 interacts with group II intron substrates via this surface. Both the sequence and the structural context of the amino acid residues essential for peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase activity are conserved in CRS2, yet expression of CRS2 is incapable of rescuing a pth(ts)E.coli strain.},

abstract = {Diurnal fluctuations of hydrological variables (e.g., shallow groundwater level or streamflow rate) are comparatively rarely investigated in the hydrologic literature although these short-term fluctuations may incorporate useful information for the characterization of hydro-ecological systems. The fluctuations can be induced by several factors like (a) alternating processes of freezing and thawing; (b) early afternoon rainfall events in the tropics; (c) changes in streambed hydraulic conductivity triggered by temperature variations, and; (d) diurnal cycle of water uptake by the vegetation. In temperate climates, one of the most important diurnal fluctuation-inducing factors is the water consumption of vegetation, therefore a detailed overview is provided on the history of such research. Beside a systematic categorization of the relevant historical studies, models that calculate groundwater evapotranspiration from diurnal fluctuations of groundwater level and/or streamflow rate have been reviewed. Compared to traditional evapotranspiration estimation methods these approaches may excel in that they generally employ a small number of parameters and/or variables to measure, are typically simple to use, and yet can yield results even on a short time-scale (i.e., hours). While, e.g., temperature-based methods of evapotranspiration are simple too, they cannot be applied or become inaccurate over shorter time periods. Similarly, traditional approaches (such as eddy-correlation or Bowen-ratio based) are accurate for shorter time steps but they require a number of measurable atmospheric input variables. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Recession analysis is a well-known tool in hydrological analysis. Its application, however, poses many methodical questions, and throughout the literature numerous solutions have been sought. The quantification of the recession curve involves the selection of an analytical expression, derivation of a characteristic recession and optimization of the recession parameters. A major problem is the high variability encountered in the recession behaviour of individual segments. The segments represent different stages in the outflow process, and a physically based short-term or seasonal influence on the recession rate adds to the problem of deriving a characteristic recession. This paper discusses these elements of recession analysis and reviews different ways of characterizing the baseflow recession rate. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {[1] Texas experienced the most extreme one-year drought on record in 2011 with precipitation at 40{\%} of long-term mean and agricultural losses of {\~{}}{\$}7.6 billion. We assess the value of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite-derived total water storage (TWS) change as an alternative remote sensing-based drought indicator, independent of traditional drought indicators based on in situ monitoring. GRACE shows depletion in TWS of 62.3 ± 17.7 km 3 during the 2011 drought. Large uncertainties in simulated soil moisture storage depletion (14–83 km 3) from six land surface models indicate that GRACE TWS is a more reliable drought indicator than disaggregated soil moisture or groundwater storage. Groundwater use and groundwater level data indicate that depletion is dominated by changes in soil moisture storage, consistent with high correlation between GRACE TWS and the Palmer Drought Severity Index. GRACE provides a valuable tool for monitoring statewide water storage depletion, linking meteorological and hydrological droughts. Citation: Long, D., B. R. Scanlon, L. Longuevergne, A.-Y. Sun, D. N.

To overcome these limitations, desirable spatial attributes of gridded climate data are combined with desirable temporal attributes of regional-scale reanalysis and daily gauge-based precipitation to derive a spatially and temporally complete, high-resolution (4-km) gridded dataset of surface meteorological variables required in ecological modelling for the contiguous United States from 1979 to 2010. Validation of the resulting gridded surface meteorological data, using an extensive network of automated weather stations across the western United States, showed skill comparable to that derived from interpolation using station observations, suggesting it can serve as suitable surrogate for landscape-scale ecological modelling across vast unmonitored areas of the United States.

In this study, we used a simple approach to estimate whole-tree CO(2) assimilation rate (A(Tree)) in a subalpine forest ecosystem. *We analysed the carbon isotope ratio (delta(13)C) of extracted needle sugars and combined it with the daytime leaf-to-air vapor pressure deficit to estimate tree water-use efficiency (WUE). The estimated WUE was then combined with observations of tree transpiration rate (E) using sap flow techniques to estimate A(Tree). Estimates of A(Tree) for the three dominant tree species in the forest were combined with species distribution and tree size to estimate and gross primary productivity (GPP) using an ecosystem process model. *A sensitivity analysis showed that estimates of A(Tree) were more sensitive to dynamics in E than delta(13)C. At the ecosystem scale, the abundance of lodgepole pine trees influenced seasonal dynamics in GPP considerably more than Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir because of its greater sensitivity of E to seasonal climate variation. *The results provide the framework for a nondestructive method for estimating whole-tree carbon assimilation rate and ecosystem GPP over daily-to weekly time scales.},

abstract = {An approach to model distributed snow water equivalence (SWE) that merges field measurements of depth and density with remotely sensed snow-covered area (SCA) is described. In 1993, two teams conducted an intensive snow survey in the 92.8 km(2) Blackcap Basin of the Kings River. Snow depth was measured at 709 points and density in five snow pits and along five transects using a Federal Sampler. Sample locations were chosen to be representative of the range of elevation, slope and aspect of the basin. Regression tree models showed that net radiation, elevation and slope angle account for 60-70{\%} of the variance in the depth measurements. Density was distributed over the basin on a 30 m grid with a multiple linear regression model that explained 70{\%} of the observed variance as a function of the same three variables.

abstract = {Accurate crop yield assessments using satellite remote sensing-based methods are of interest for regional monitoring and the design of policies that promote agricultural resiliency and food security. However, the application of current vegetation productivity algorithms derived from global satellite observations is generally too coarse to capture cropland heterogeneity. The fusion of data from different sensors can provide enhanced information and overcome many of the limitations of individual sensors. In thitables study, we estimate annual crop yields for seven important crop types across Montana in the continental USA from 2008–2015, including alfalfa, barley, maize, peas, durum wheat, spring wheat and winter wheat. We used a satellite data-driven light use efficiency (LUE) model to estimate gross primary productivity (GPP) over croplands at 30-m spatial resolution and eight-day time steps using a fused NDVI dataset constructed by blending Landsat (5 or 7) and Terra MODIS reflectance data. The fused 30-m NDVI record showed good consistency with the original Landsat and MODIS data, but provides better spatiotemporal delineations of cropland vegetation growth. Crop yields were estimated at 30-m resolution as the product of estimated GPP accumulated over the growing season and a crop-specific harvest index (HI GPP). The resulting GPP estimates capture characteristic cropland productivity patterns and seasonal variations, while the estimated annual crop production results correspond favorably with reported county-level crop production data (r = 0.96, relative RMSE = 37.0{\%}, p {\textless} 0.05) from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The performance of estimated crop yields at a finer (field) scale was generally lower, but still meaningful (r = 0.42, relative RMSE = 50.8{\%}, p {\textless} 0.05). Our methods and results are suitable for operational applications of crop yield monitoring at regional scales, suggesting the potential of using global satellite observations to improve agricultural management, policy decisions and regional/global food security.},

is usually estimated from some roughness index. The objective of
this study was to compare the ability of selected roughness indices
to describe maximum depressional storage (MDS). Height measurements
were taken on 221 tilled soil surfaces across a range of roughnesses.
Maximum depressional storage was determined from digital elevation
models (DEMs). The MDS values ranged from 0 to 13 mm. Five roughness
indices were calculated from transects across these DEMs: random
roughness (RR), tortuosity (T), limiting elevation difference (LD)
and slope (LS), and mean upslope depression (MUD). Regression analysis
of MDS on each of five roughness indices showed that RR best described
depressional storage. Prediction of MDS in the field based on RR
has an uncertainty of {\{}+/-{\}} 3 mm (95{\%} confidence interval). Variation
was due to RR and its nonspatial nature. To improve predictions of
MDS, the spatial configuration of the surface has to be taken into
account.},

Because seasonal variations in CO(2) flux in temperate forests are closely correlated with plant phenology, we quantified the phenology of forest species in a multilayered forest with patches of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and oak (Quercus robur L.) in Brasschaat, Belgium. A scaling-up modeling approach was developed to simulate reflectance at the leaf and canopy scales over a one-year cycle. Chlorophyll concentration, water content, specific leaf area and leaf area index of the forest species were measured throughout an entire year (1997). Scaling-up from the leaf to canopy was achieved by linking the PROSPECT and SAIL models. The result is the annual progression of the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) in a 1 km(2) forest area, which can be directly related to high-resolution, remotely sensed data.},

abstract = {In high-altitude alpine catchments, diurnal streamflow cycles are typically dominated by snowmelt or ice melt. Evapotranspiration-induced diurnal streamflow cycles are less observed in these catchments but might happen simultaneously. During a field campaign in the summer 2012 in an alpine catchment in the Swiss Alps (Val Ferret catchment, 20.4 km(2), glaciarized area: 2{\%}), we observed a transition in the early season from a snowmelt to an evapotranspiration-induced diurnal streamflow cycle in one of two monitored subbasins. The two different cycles were of comparable amplitudes and the transition happened within a time span of several days. In the second monitored subbasin, we observed an ice melt-dominated diurnal cycle during the entire season due to the presence of a small glacier. Comparisons between ice melt and evapotranspiration cycles showed that the two processes were happening at the same times of day but with a different sign and a different shape. The amplitude of the ice melt cycle decreased exponentially during the season and was larger than the amplitude of the evapotranspiration cycle which was relatively constant during the season. Our study suggests that an evapotranspiration-dominated diurnal streamflow cycle could damp the ice melt-dominated diurnal streamflow cycle. The two types of diurnal streamflow cycles were separated using a method based on the identification of the active riparian area and measurement of evapotranspiration.},

Observations of soil moisture have revealed a variety of patterns - generally, in semiarid regions variance increased as mean soil moisture content increased, in humid regions variance decreased as mean soil moisture content increased, and in temperate regions variance peaked at intermediate moisture contents. We collected soil moisture data at Big Meadows, an upland wetland in Shenandoah National Park, Virginia, and we observed peak variance at intermediate moisture contents, consistent with other sites in temperate climate zones. A modified soil moisture dynamics model was used to examine how soil moisture patterns evolve through time, how topography, soil, and vegetation affect these patterns, and how the trends observed across climate zones can be explained. The trends observed relate to theoretical bounds on soil moisture distributions, i.e., the wilting point and the porosity.},

From Duplicate 2 ( Fifty-seven-year California Reanalysis Downscaling at 10 km (CaRD10). Part I: System detail and validation with observations - Kanamitsu, M; Kanamaru, H )

For the purpose of producing datasets for regional-scale climate change research and application, the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis for the period 1948-2005 was dynamically downscaled to hourly, 10-km resolution over California using the Regional Spectral Model. This is Part I of a two-part paper, describing the details of the downscaling system and comparing the downscaled analysis [California Reanalysis Downscaling at 10 km (CaRD10)] against observation and global analysis. An extensive validation of the downscaled analysis was performed using station observations, Higgins gridded precipitation analysis, and Precipitation-Elevation Regression on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) precipitation analysis. In general, the CaRD10 near-surface wind and temperature fit better to regional-scale station observations than the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis used to force the regional model, supporting the premise that the regional downscaling is a viable method to attain regional detail from large-scale analysis. This advantage of CaRD10 was found on all time scales, ranging from hourly to decadal scales (i.e., from diurnal variation to multidecadal trend). Dynamically downscaled analysis provides ways to study various regional climate phenomena of different time scales because all produced variables are dynamically, physically, and hydrologically consistent. However, the CaRD10 is not free from problems. It suffers from positive bias in precipitation for heavy precipitation events. The CaRD10 is inaccurate near the lateral boundary where regional detail is damped by the lateral boundary relaxation. It is important to understand these limitations before the downscaled analysis is used for research.},

abstract = {Most evergreen oak forests growing in the flat areas of the southwestern
Iberian Peninsula have been gradually transformed into a unique kind
of pastoral woodland, the Spanish dehesas and Portuguese montados,
by means of an agroforestry use. The opening of dehesas by clearing
and ploughing closed forest to obtain savannah-like landscapes with
a density of some 40 trees per ha started in the early Middle Ages,
although most current dehesas were created during the last half of
the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. Dehesas cover
at present an estimated 3.1 million ha and support a high biological
diversity. In this paper we compare the current age structure of
holm oak Quercus ilex L. dehesas and forests in order to ascertain
whether the agroforestry use is hampering the natural regeneration
of tree populations and hence the long-term sustainability of dehesas.
We characterise the size structure of both mature trees and minor
stems growing in forests and dehesas in two intensively studied plots,
and then we develop indicators for population structure at wider
spatial scale (10 dehesa and 10 forest replicates). Size structure
could be reliably used as an indicator of age structure as neither
site quality nor intraspecific competition could account for the
variation in tree size observed neither within nor among the studied
holm oak populations. The age structure of mature trees in forests
closely fitted a negative exponential distribution, thus indicating
a continuous input of individuals to the youngest age class (67.4{\%}
of mature trees on average for the 10 replicates). Contrary to this,
in dehesa replicates the age distribution of mature trees was symmetrical
and leptokurtic due to the disproportionate importance (78.0{\%}) of
central age classes (30-40 cm in diameter at breast height (DBH)).
Apart from showing that the regeneration failure of dehesas is due
to their agroforestry use, we suggest that this problem is inherent
to their system of exploitation, i.e. it operates ever since each
dehesa farm starts to be formed out from forests, although it has
been exacerbated by the recent intensification of the agroforestry
use of dehesas.},

We used the fully-distributed ecohydrological model EcH2O, calibrated against long-term datasets that encompass hydrologic and energy exchanges, and ecological measurements. Applying diverse combinations of these constraints revealed that calibration against virtually all datasets enabled the model to reproduce streamflow reasonably well. However, parameterizing the model to adequately capture local flux and storage dynamics, such as soil moisture or transpiration, required calibration with specific observations. This indicates that the footprint of the information contained in observations varies for each type of dataset, and that a diverse database informing about the different compartments of the domain, is critical to identify consistent model parameterizations. These results foster confidence in using EcH2O to contribute to understanding current and future ecohydrological couplings in Northern catchments.},

abstract = {To assess the influence of storage dynamics and nonlinearities in hydrological connectivity on time-variant stream water ages, we used a new long-term record of daily isotope measurements in precipitation and streamflow to calibrate and test a parsimonious tracer-aided runoff model. This can track tracers and the ages of water fluxes through and between conceptual stores in steeper hillslopes, dynamically saturated riparian peatlands, and deeper groundwater; these represent the main landscape units involved in runoff generation. Storage volumes are largest in groundwater and on the hillslopes, though most dynamic mixing occurs in the smaller stores in riparian peat. Both streamflow and isotope variations are generally well captured by the model, and the simulated storage and tracer dynamics in the main landscape units are consistent with independent measurements. The model predicts that the average age of stream water is ∼1.8 years. On a daily basis, this varies between ∼1 month in storm events, when younger waters draining the hillslope and riparian peatland dominates, to around 4 years in dry periods when groundwater sustains flow. This variability reflects the integration of differently aged water fluxes from the main landscape units and their mixing in riparian wetlands. The connectivity between these spatial units varies in a nonlinear way with storage that depends upon precipitation characteristics and antecedent conditions. This, in turn, determines the spatial distribution of flow paths and the integration of their contrasting nonstationary ages. This approach is well suited for constraining process-based modeling in a range of northern temperate and boreal environments.},

In general, below pressure heads of about {\&}{\#}8722;0.05 m, 			 soil-water contents change slightly with changes in pressure head, but 			 above {\&}{\#}8722;0.05 m the soil-water content is highly variable. Minor 			 rainstorms upon a wet soil can produce slight changes in pressure head and 			 corresponding large changes in soil-water content, giving rise to the 			 passage of pressure waves in response to increased rain intensity and a 			 relatively rapid response in the unsaturated zone. This rapid unsaturated zone 			 response led to a rapid rise in the saturated zone, and it may be the 			 underlying mechanism enabling short bursts of rain to cause slope 			 instability.},

However, our current understanding of the role of riparian zones in mediating landscape hydrologic connectivity and the catchment scale export of water and solutes is limited. We tested the relationship between the duration of hillslope-riparian-stream (HRS) hydrologic connectivity and the rate and degree of riparian shallow groundwater turnover along four HRS well transects within a set of nested mountain catchments (Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest, MT). Transect HRS water table connectivity ranged from 9 to 123 days during the annual snowmelt hydrograph. Hillslope water was always characterized by low specific conductance (similar to 27 mu S cm(-1)). In transects with transient hillslope water tables, riparian groundwater specific conductance was elevated during base flow conditions (similar to 127 mu S cm(-1)) but shifted toward hillslope signatures once a HRS groundwater connection was established. The degree of riparian groundwater turnover was proportional to the duration of HRS connectivity and inversely related to the riparian: hillslope area ratios (buffer ratio; r(2) = 0.95). We applied this relationship to the stream network in seven subcatchments within the Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest and compared their turnover distributions to source water contributions measured at each catchment outlet. The amount of riparian groundwater exiting each of the seven catchments was linearly related (r(2) = 0.92) to their median riparian turnover time. Our observations suggest that the size and spatial arrangement of hillslope and riparian zones along a stream network and the timing and duration of groundwater connectivity between them is a first-order control on the magnitude and timing of water and solutes observed at the catchment outlet.},

@article{Beven2001a,
abstract = {It may be endemic to mechanistic modelling of complex environmental
systems that there are many different model structures and many different
parameter sets within a chosen model structure that may be behavioural
or acceptable in reproducing the observed behaviour of that system.
This has been called the equifinality concept. The generalised likelihood
uncertainty estimation (GLUE) methodology for model identification
allowing for equifinality is described. Prediction within this methodology
is a process of ensemble forecasting using a sample of parameter
sets from the behavioural model space, with each sample weighted
according to its likelihood measure to estimate prediction quantiles.
This allows that different models may contribute to the ensemble
prediction interval at different time steps and that the distributional
form of the predictions may change over time. Any effects of model
nonlinearity, covariation of parameter values and errors in model
structure, input data or observed variables, with which the simulations
are compared, are handled implicitly within this procedure. GLUE
involves a number of choices that must be made explicit and can be
therefore subjected to scrutiny and discussion. These include ways
of combining information from different types of model evaluation
or from different periods in a data assimilation context. An example
application to rainfall-runoff modelling is used to illustrate the
methodology, including the updating of likelihood measures.},

It was found that the daily reduction in stream flow was accompanied by a reduction in the total ion concentration. The drought hydrograph was separated into two components, assuming the drought flow to be a mixture of ionically dense throughflow and of ionically dilute groundwater flow entering the stream in its lower reaches.},

abstract = {Many remote sensing applications are devoted to the agricultural sector. Representative case studies are presented in the special issue “Advances in Remote Sensing of Agriculture”. To complement the examples published within the special issue, a few main applications with regional to global focus were selected for this review, where remote sensing contributions are traditionally strong. The selected applications are put in the context of the global challenges the agricultural sector is facing: minimizing the environmental impact, while increasing production and productivity. Five different applications have been selected, which are illustrated and described: (1) biomass and yield estimation, (2) vegetation vigor and drought stress monitoring, (3) assessment of crop phenological development, (4) crop acreage estimation and cropland mapping and (5) mapping of disturbances and land use/land cover (LULC) changes. Many other applications exist, such as precision agriculture and irrigation management (see other special issues of this journal), but were not included to keep the paper concise. The paper starts with an overview of the main agricultural challenges. This section is followed by a brief overview of existing operational monitoring systems. Finally, in the main part of the paper, the mentioned applications are described and illustrated. The review concludes with some key recommendations.},

abstract = {The Lake Tahoe basin is experiencing an environmental decline that is partly due to sediment intakes from its tributaries. Many studies have estimated suspended sediment loads in these streams with a discrete sampling programme by collecting water samples and using a rating technique.

In this study, suspended sediment transport was investigated using a turbidity meter to provide a continuous record of sediment concentration during the snowmelt period. Hysteresis in suspended sediment transport was also investigated and is quantified with an H index, which is the ratio of the areas under the curve at different stages of the hydrograph. The temporal lag between the peak of SSC and the peak of stream discharge was quantified using cross-correlation analysis. For almost all events, SSCs were higher during the rising limb of the hydrograph for a given discharge, with SSC peaks occurring before discharge peaks, resulting in clockwise hysteresis (H {\textgreater} 1). The H indices increased (looser hysteresis loop) as the availability of sediments increased and as the lag between peaks in SSC and discharge was larger. A restriction of the proposed H index was that it could only be computed when stream discharge increased by more than 30{\%} during a melt event. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Two Monte Carlo-based approaches for assessing parameter uncertainty
in complex hydrologic models are considered. The first, known as
importance sampling, has been implemented in the generalised likelihood
uncertainty estimation (GLUE) framework of Beven and Binley. The
second, known as the Metropolis algorithm, differs from importance
sampling in that it uses a random walk that adapts to the true probability
distribution describing parameter uncertainty. Three case studies
are used to investigate and illustrate these Monte Carlo approaches.
The first considers a simple water balance model for which exact
results are known. It is shown that importance sampling is inferior
to Metropolis sampling. Unless a large number of random samples are
drawn, importance sampling can produce seriously misleading results.
The second and third case studies consider more complex catchment
models to illustrate the insights the Metropolis algorithm can offer.
They demonstrate assessment of parameter uncertainty in the presence
of bimodality, evaluation of the significance of split-sample tests,
use of prior information and the assessment of confidence limits
on hydrologic responses not used in calibration. When compared with
the capabilities of traditional inference based on first-order approximation,
the Metropolis algorithm provides a quantum advance in our capability
to deal with parameter uncertainty in hydrologic models.},

procedures were tested for their ability to characterize microrelief.Runoff
boxes filled with soil from the plough layer of a silty Luvisol were
subjected to simulated rainfall. Two types of microrelief (rough
and fine) were tested at two rainfall intensities (30 and 60 mm/h).
A photogrammetric technique was used to develop digital elevation
models (DEMs) of the soil surface before and after rainfall with
a resolution in height of 0.2 mm and a grid spacing of 2 mm.The random
roughness coefficient according to Currence {\&} Lovely (1970) was found
to be sensitive to surface microrelief variations. Semivariograms
of the data indicated that big clods were the main elements determining
microrelief and the ratio of total surface are to map area. The observed
variations in runoff as a function of microrelief were best explained
by rainfall energy per total surface area and by the relative contribution
of the effective normal component of kinetic energy with respect
to the impact angle of raindrops. Microdepression storage was only
0.6 mm or less and was found to be negligible in terms of runoff.},

Our results show that low temperature constraints on Boreal-Arctic NPP are decreasing by 0.43{\%} per year (P {\textless} 0.001), whereas a positive trend in vegetation moisture constraints of 0.49{\%} per year (P = 0.04) are offsetting the potential benefits of longer growing seasons and contributing to recent disturbances in NPP. The PEM simulations of NPP seasonality, annual anomalies and trends are similar to stand inventory network measurements of boreal aspen stem growth (r = 0.56; P = 0.007) and atmospheric CO(2) measurement based estimates of the timing of growing season onset (r = 0.78; P {\textless} 0.001). Our results indicate that summer drought led to marked NPP decreases in much of the boreal forest region after the late-1990s. However, seasonal low temperatures are still a dominant limitation on regional NPP. Despite recent drought events, mean annual NPP for the pan-Arctic region showed a positive growth trend of 0.34{\%} per year (20.27 TgC/a; P = 0.002) from 1983 to 2005. Drought induced NPP decreases may become more frequent and widespread as regional ecosystems adjust to a warmer, drier atmosphere, though the occurrence and severity of drought events will depend on future patterns of plant-available moisture.},

abstract = {Soil moisture controls the partitioning of moisture and energy fluxes at the land surface and is a key variable in weather and climate prediction. The performance of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for soil moisture estimation is assessed by assimilating L-band (1.4 GHz) microwave radiobrightness observations into a land surface model. An optimal smoother (a dynamic variational method) is used as a benchmark for evaluating the filter's performance. In a series of synthetic experiments the effect of ensemble size and non-Gaussian forecast errors on the estimation accuracy of the EnKF is investigated. With a state vector dimension of 4608 and a relatively small ensemble size of 30 (or 100; or 500), the actual errors in surface soil moisture at the final update time are reduced by 55{\%} (or 70{\%}; or 80{\%}) from the value obtained without assimilation (as compared to 84{\%} for the optimal smoother). For robust error variance estimates, an ensemble of at least 500 members is needed. The dynamic evolution of the estimation error variances is dominated by wetting and drying events with high variances during drydown and low variances when the soil is either very wet or very dry. Furthermore, the ensemble distribution of soil moisture is typically symmetric except under very dry or wet conditions when the effects of the nonlinearities in the model become significant. As a result, the actual errors are consistently larger than ensemble-derived forecast and analysis error variances. This suggests that the update is suboptimal. However, the degree of suboptimality is relatively small and results presented here indicate that the EnKF is a flexible and robust data assimilation option that gives satisfactory estimates even for moderate ensemble sizes.},

An analysis of climate risks for crops in 12 food-insecure regions was conducted to identify adaptation priorities, based on statistical crop models and climate projections for 2030 from 20 general circulation models. Results indicate South Asia and Southern Africa as two regions that, without sufficient adaptation measures, will likely suffer negative impacts on several crops that are important to large food-insecure human populations. We also find that uncertainties vary widely by crop, and therefore priorities will depend on the risk attitudes of investment institutions.},

abstract = {A common assumption of remote sensing-based light use efficiency (LUE) models for estimating vegetation gross primary productivity (GPP) is that plants in a biome matrix operate at their photosynthetic capacity under optimal climatic conditions. A prescribed constant biome maximum light use efficiency parameter (LUEmax) defines the maximum photosynthetic carbon conversion rate under these conditions and is a large source of model uncertainty. Here we used tower eddy covariance measurement-based carbon (CO2) fluxes for spatial estimation of optimal LUE (LUEopt) across North America. LUEopt was estimated at 62 Flux Network sites using tower daily carbon fluxes and meteorology, and satellite observed fractional photosynthetically active radiation from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. A geostatistical model was fitted to 45 flux tower-derived LUEopt data points using independent geospatial environmental variables, including global plant traits, soil moisture, terrain aspect, land cover type, and percent tree cover, and validated at 17 independent tower sites. Estimated LUEopt shows large spatial variability within and among different land cover classes indicated from the sparse tower network. Leaf nitrogen content and soil moisture regime are major factors explaining LUEopt patterns. GPP derived from estimated LUEopt shows significant correlation improvement against tower GPP records (R2 = 76.9{\%}; mean root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 257 g C m−2 yr−1), relative to alternative GPP estimates derived using biome-specific LUEmax constants (R2 = 34.0{\%}; RMSE = 439 g C m−2 yr−1). GPP determined from the LUEopt map also explains a 49.4{\%} greater proportion of tower GPP variability at the independent validation sites and shows promise for improving understanding of LUE patterns and environmental controls and enhancing regional GPP monitoring from satellite remote sensing.},

abstract = {Maps of current and potential vegetation spatial patterns can be used
to assess land cover changes, and aid in ecosystem management and
restoration. The vegetation spatial patterns of subalpine forest
species are largely controlled by variation in temperature, water
and solar radiation resources. These fundamental resources were quantified
across a 1100-km2 landscape using biophysical models, a digital elevation
model (DEM), and weather station data. Field data of species abundances
were used to define species-habitat relationships and calibrate maximum
likelihood classifications of the biophysical gradients. For comparison,
a standard land cover classification of Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite
imagery had an overall accuracy 68.3{\%}. Using the biophysical gradients
alone gave a similar 67.4{\%} accuracy. The highest accuracy classification
(83.2{\%}) used both biophysical and spectral data. The biophysical
resources were also used to map the presence or absence of four herb
and shrub species that cannot be sensed remotely. These predictions
ranged from 60{\%} to 79{\%} accurate. Maps of relative abundance were
less accurate, from 61{\%} to 63.2{\%}. This low result may be due to historical
and stochastic events, or simply a small data set. The spatial pattern
of species and communities that are controlled by resources can be
predicted using general biophysical models. The species-habitat relationships
can also be used to improve remote sensing products.},

abstract = {Temporal and spatial variability of water content in soil results
from a complex interaction of different factors such as duration
and frequency of rainfall, soil layering, vegetation, and topography.
The objectives of this study were (i) to use a resistant median-polishing
scheme to quantify the temporal variability of a depth and a horizontal
location factor in an additive model, and (ii) to investigate the
time stability of those two factors at a detailed temporal scale
during different infiltration and redistributions cycles. Time series
of water content were measured at 5 depths and 12 locations along
a transect of 6 m using Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR). Measurements
were repeated every 2-hours for 168 days under natural boundary conditions.
At each time step, the mean water content of the soil profile, 5
depth factors and 12 location factors were estimated. The time series
of these factors were qualitatively interpreted and related to the
atmospheric and prevailing soil conditions. It was found that micro-heterogeneity
plays an important role, even at this small plot-scale. The relative
contributions of the factors were dependent on the antecedent soil
moisture conditions. Also, the ratio of the deterministic variance,
i.e., variance explained by the deterministic factors, of water content
to the observed variance is variable in time.},

abstract = {In this study, we use observations from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission to evaluate freshwater storage trends in the north-central Middle East, including portions of the Tigris and Euphrates River Basins and western Iran, from January 2003 to December 2009. GRACE data show an alarming rate of decrease in total water storage of approximately -27.2±0.6 mm yr(-1) equivalent water height, equal to a volume of 143.6 km(3) during the course of the study period. Additional remote-sensing information and output from land surface models were used to identify that groundwater losses are the major source of this trend. The approach used in this study provides an example of "best current capabilities" in regions like the Middle East, where data access can be severely limited. Results indicate that the region lost 17.3±2.1 mm yr(-1) equivalent water height of groundwater during the study period, or 91.3±10.9 km(3) in volume. Furthermore, results raise important issues regarding water use in transboundary river basins and aquifers, including the necessity of international water use treaties and resolving discrepancies in international water law, while amplifying the need for increased monitoring for core components of the water budget.},

abstract = {The volume of water stored within a catchment, and its partitioning among ground- water, soilmoisture, snowpack, vegetation, and surface water are the variables that ultimately characterize the state of the hydrologic system. Accordingly, storage may provide useful metrics for catchment comparison. Unfortunately, measur- ing and predicting the amount of water present in a catchment is seldom done; tracking the dynamics of these stores is even rarer. Storage moderates fluxes and exerts critical controls on a wide range of hydrologic and biologic functions of a catchment. While understanding runoff generation and other processes by which catchments release water will always be central to hydrologic science, it is equally essential to understand how catchments retain water. We have initiated a catch- ment comparison exercise to begin assessing the value of viewing catchments from the storage perspective. The exercise is based on existing data from five watersheds, no common experimental design, and no integratedmodelling efforts. Rather, stor- age was estimated independently for each site. This briefing presents some initial results of the exercise, poses questions about the definitions and importance of storage and the storage perspective, and suggests future directions for ongoing activities.

Here we undertake the first comprehensive examination of the potential impact of global climate change on armed conflict in sub-Saharan Africa. We find strong historical linkages between civil war and temperature in Africa, with warmer years leading to significant increases in the likelihood of war. When combined with climate model projections of future temperature trends, this historical response to temperature suggests a roughly 54{\%} increase in armed conflict incidence by 2030, or an additional 393,000 battle deaths if future wars are as deadly as recent wars. Our results suggest an urgent need to reform African governments' and foreign aid donors' policies to deal with rising temperatures.},

abstract = {Abstract The energy and water balances at the earth's surface are dramatically influenced by the presence of snow cover. Therefore, soil temperature and moisture for snow-covered and snow-free areas can be very different. In computing these soil state variables, many land surface schemes in climate models do not explicitly distinguish between snow-covered and snow-free areas. Even if they do, some schemes average these state variables to calculate grid-mean energy fluxes and these averaged state variables are then used at the beginning of the next time step. This latter approach introduces a numerical error in that heat is redistributed from snow-free areas to snow-covered areas, resulting in a more rapid snowmelt. This study focuses on the latter approach and examines the sensitivity of soil moisture and streamflow to the treatment of the soil state variables in the presence of snow cover by using WATCLASS, a land surface scheme linked with a hydrologic model. The model was tested for the 1993 snowmelt p...},

The institutional arrangements for the agriculture and water sectors are complex and multi-dimensional, and integration cannot therefore be achieved through a simplistic 'additive' policy process. Effective integration requires the development of a new collaborative approach to governance that is designed to cope with scale dependencies and interactions, uncertainty and contested knowledge, and interdependency among diverse and unequal interests. When combined with interdisciplinary research, collaborative governance provides a viable normative model because of its emphasis on reciprocity, relationships, learning and creativity. Ultimately, such an approach could lead to the sorts of system adaptations and transformations that are required for IWAM.},

Observations of surface snowmelt, meltwater flux, and streamflow for the snowmelt period confirm the nature of meltwater flow as described by the unsaturated flow equations, and illustrate the controlling influence of snowpack hydraulics on the streamflow hydrograph. Observed speeds of the meltwater wave front in the snowpack average about 0.22 m h{\^{a}}ˆ'1 and capillary pressures and kinematic wave speeds observed are comparable to those reported in other deep-snow environments. The difficulty of obtaining reliable liquid water content measurements is identified as a major limitation in the determination of hydraulic properties of the snowpack.},

Higher soil moisture/VI lag correlations imply an enhanced ability to predict future vegetation conditions using estimates of current soil moisture. Results demonstrate that the assimilation of AMSR-E surface soil moisture retrievals substantially improve the performance of a global drought monitoring system - particularly in sparsely-instrumented areas of the world where high-quality rainfall observations are unavailable.},

abstract = {Many studies addressing climate change and climate variability over large regions rely on gridded data. Grids are preferred to station-based data sets because they help avoiding bias arising from the irregular spatial distribution of the observations. However, while spatial interpolation techniques used for constructing gridded data are good at preserving the mean of the data, they do not offer an adequate representation of their variance. In fact, the grid's variance depends largely on the spatial density of observations used for constructing it. Most global and regional climate data sets are characterized by large temporal changes in the number of observations available for interpolation, with a strong reduction in the last 30 years. These changes in the sample size result in changes in the variance of gridded data that are merely an effect of the interpolation process, and ignoring this fact may lead to erroneous conclusions about changes in climate variability and extremes. We discuss this problem and we demonstrate its importance with a widely used global dataset of temperature and precipitation. We propose to move from interpolation techniques towards statistical simulation approaches that provide a better representation of climate variability when constructing climatic grids.},

@article{Ghosh2014,
abstract = {Despite recognition of the potential economic benefits and increasing interest in developing marketing instruments, water markets have remained thin and slow to evolve due to high transactions costs, third party effects, and the persistence of historical institutions for water allocation. Water banks are a marketing instrument that can address these obstacles to trade, allowing irrigators within a region to exchange water in order to mitigate the short-term effects of drought. Water banks coexist with the institu- tions governing water allocation, which implies that rule changes, such as adoption of a system of conjunc- tive surface water-groundwater administration, carry implications for the economic impacts of banking. This paper assesses and compares the welfare and distributional outcomes for irrigators in the Eastern Snake River Plain of Idaho under a suite of water management and drought scenarios. We find that water banking can offset irrigators' profit losses during drought, but that its ability to do so depends on whether it facili- tates trade across groundwater and surface water users. With conjunctive administration, a bank allowing trade by source realizes 22.23{\%} of the maximum potential efficiency gains from trade during a severe drought, while a bank that allows trade across sources realizes 93.47{\%} of the maximum potential gains. Dur- ing drought, conjunctive administration redistributes welfare from groundwater to surface water producers, but banking across sources allows groundwater irrigators to recover 88.4{\%} of the profits lost from drought at a cost of 2.2{\%} of the profit earned by surface water irrigators},

abstract = {Our understanding of short- and long-term dynamics of spatial soil moisture patterns is limited due to measurement constraints. Using new highly detailed data, this research aims to examine seasonal and event-scale spatial soil moisture dynamics in the topsoil and subsoil of the small spruce-covered W{\"{u}}stebach catchment, Germany. To accomplish this, univariate and geo-statistical analyses were performed for a 1 year long 4-D data set obtained with the wireless sensor network SoilNet. We found large variations in spatial soil moisture patterns in the topsoil, mostly related to meteorological forcing. In the subsoil, temporal dynamics were diminished due to soil water redistribution processes and root water uptake. Topsoil range generally increased with decreasing soil moisture. The relationship between the spatial standard deviation of the topsoil soil moisture (SD{\&}{\#}952;) and mean water content ({\&}{\#}952;¯) showed a convex shape, as has often been found in humid temperate climate conditions. Observed scatter in topsoil SD{\&}{\#}952;({\&}{\#}952;¯) was explained by seasonal and event-scale SD{\&}{\#}952;({\&}{\#}952;¯) dynamics, possibly involving hysteresis at both time scales. Clockwise hysteretic SD{\&}{\#}952;({\&}{\#}952;¯) dynamics at the event scale were generated under moderate soil moisture conditions only for intense precipitation that rapidly wetted the topsoil and increased soil moisture variability controlled by spruce throughfall patterns. This hysteretic effect increased with increasing precipitation, reduced root water uptake, and high groundwater level. Intense precipitation on dry topsoil abruptly increased SD{\&}{\#}952; but only marginally increased mean soil moisture. This was due to different soil rewetting behavior in drier upslope areas (hydrophobicity and preferential flow caused minor topsoil recharge) compared with the moderately wet valley bottom (topsoil water storage), which led to a more spatially organized pattern. This study showed that spatial soil moisture patterns monitored by a wireless sensor network varied with depth, soil moisture content, seasonally, and within single wetting and drying episodes. This was controlled by multiple factors including soil properties, topography, meteorological forcing, vegetation, and groundwater.},

abstract = {A Bayesian approach for calibrating a hidden Markov model (HMM) to
long-term multi-site rainfall time series is presented. Using a HMM
approach for simulating long-term persistence is attractive because
it has an explicit mechanism to produce long-term wet and dry periods
which are a feature of many long-term hydrological time series. The
ability to fully evaluate parameter uncertainty for the multi-site
HMM represents an advance in the stochastic modelling of long-term
persistence in multi-site hydrological time series. The challenges
in applying the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method known
as the Gibbs sampler to infer the posterior distribution of the multi-site
HMM parameters are fully outlined. The specification of appropriate
prior distributions was found to be crucial for the successful implementation
of the Gibbs sampler. It is described how using synthetic data led
to the development of an appropriate prior specification. Further
synthetic data analysis showed how the benefits of space-for-time
substitution for identifying the long-term persistence structure
are dependent on the spatial correlation that exists in multi-site
data. A methodology for handling missing data is also described.
This study highlights the important role of the priors in Bayesian
analysis using MCMC methods by illustrating that misleading inferences
can result if the priors are inappropriately specified.},

abstract = {Microwave radiometry at low frequencies (L-band: 1.4 GHz, 21 cm) is an established technique for estimating surface soil moisture and sea surface salinity with a suitable sensitivity. However, from space, large antennas (several meters) are required to achieve an adequate spatial resolution at L-band. So as to reduce the problem of putting into orbit a large filled antenna, the possibility of using antenna synthesis methods has been investigated. Such a system, relying on a deployable structure, has now proved to be feasible and has led to the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission, which is described. The main objective of the SMOS mission is to deliver key variables of the land surfaces (soil moisture fields), and of ocean surfaces (sea surface salinity fields). The SMOS mission is based on a dual polarized L-band radiometer using aperture synthesis (two-dimensional [2D] interferometer) so as to achieve a ground resolution of 50 km at the swath edges coupled with multiangular acquisitions. The radiometer will enable frequent and global coverage of the globe and deliver surface soil moisture fields over land and sea surface salinity over the oceans. The SMOS mission was proposed to the European Space Agency (ESA) in the framework of the Earth Explorer Opportunity Missions. It was selected for a tentative launch in 2005. The goal of this paper is to present the main aspects of the baseline mission and describe how soil moisture will be retrieved from SMOS data},

In this reconstruction approach, modeled snowmelt over each pixel is integrated during the period of satellite-observed snow cover to estimate SWE. Due to underestimates in snow cover detection, maximum basin-wide mean SWE using MODIS and AVHRR were, respectively, 45{\%} and 68{\%} lower than SWE estimates obtained using ETM+ data. The mean absolute error (MAE) of SWE estimated at 100-m resolution using ETM+ data was 23{\%} relative to observed SWE from intensive field campaigns. Model performance deteriorated when MODIS (MAE - 50{\%}) and AVHRR (MAE = 89{\%}) SCA data were used. Relative to differences in the SCA products, model output was less sensitive to spatial resolution (MAE = 39{\%} and 73{\%} for ETM+ and MODIS simulations run at 1 km resolution, respectively), indicating that SWE reconstructions at the scale of MODIS acquisitions may be tractable provided the SCA product is improved. When considering tradeoffs between spatial and temporal resolution of different sensors, our results indicate that higher spatial resolution products such as ETM+ remain more accurate despite the lower frequency of acquisition.

We analyzed global phenology cycles over a six year record (2003-2008) using satellite passive microwave remote sensing based Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) retrievals derived from daily time series brightness temperature (T(b)) measurements from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on EOS (AMSR-E) and other ancillary data inputs. The VOD parameter derives vegetation canopy attenuation at a given microwave frequency (18.7 GHz) and varies with canopy height, density, structure and water content. An error sensitivity analysis indicates that the retrieval algorithm can resolve the VOD seasonal cycle over a majority of global vegetated land areas. The VOD results corresponded favorably (p {\textless} 0.01) with vegetation indices (VIs) and leaf area index (lid) information from satellite optical-infrared (MODIS) remote sensing, and phenology cycles determined from a simple bioclimatic growing season index (GSI) for over 82{\%} of the global domain. Lower biomass land cover classes (e.g. savannas) show the highest correlations (R=0.66), with reduced correspondence at higher biomass levels (0.03 {\textless} R {\textless} 0.51) and higher correlations for homogeneous land cover areas (0.41 {\textless} R {\textless} 0.83). The VOD results display a unique end-of-season signal relative to VI and LAI series, and may reflect microwave sensitivity to the timing of vegetation biomass depletion (e.g. leaf abscission) and associated changes in canopy water content (e.g. dormancy preparation). The VOD parameter is independent of and synergistic with optical-infrared remote sensing based vegetation metrics, and contributes to a more comprehensive view of land surface phenology.

abstract = {Four timely and broadly available remotely sensed datasets were assessed for inclusion into county-level corn and soybean yield forecasting efforts focused on the Corn Belt region of the central United States (US). Those datasets were the (1) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as derived from the Terra satellite's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), (2) daytime and (3) nighttime land surface temperature (LST) as derived from Aqua satellite's MODIS, and (4) precipitation from the National Weather Service (NWS) Nexrad-based gridded data product. The originating MODIS data utilized were the globally produced 8-day, clear sky composited science products (MOD09Q1 and MYD11A2), while the US-wide NWS data were manipulated to mesh with the MODIS imagery both spatially and temporally by regridding and summing the otherwise daily measurements. The crop growing seasons of 2006-2011 were analyzed with each year bounded by 32 8-day periods from mid-February through late October. Land cover classifications known as the Cropland Data Layer as produced annually by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) were used to isolate the input dataset pixels as to corn and soybeans for each of the corresponding years. The relevant pixels were then averaged by crop and time period to produce a county-level estimate of NDVI, the LSTs, and precipitation. They in turn were related to official annual NASS county level yield statistics. For the Corn Belt region as a whole, both corn and soybean yields were found to be positively correlated with NDVI in the middle of the summer and negatively correlated to daytime LST at that same time. Nighttime LST and precipitation showed no correlations to yield, regardless of the time prior or during the growing season. There was also slight suggestion of low NDVI and high daytime LST in the spring being positively related to final yields, again for both crops. Taking only NDVI and daytime LST as inputs from the 2006-2011 dataset, regression tree-based models were built and county-level, within-sample coefficients of determination (R2) of 0.93 were found for both crops. Limiting the models by systematically removing late season data showed the model performance to remain strong even at mid-season and still viable even earlier. Finally, the derived models were used to predict out-of-sample for the 2012 season, which ended up having an anomalous drought. Yet, the county-level results compared reasonably well against official statistics with R2=0.77 for corn and 0.71 for soybeans. The root-mean-square errors were 1.26 and 0.42metrictonsper hectare, respectively. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Rivers in which water is added diurnally, as in snowmelt, and rivers in which water is removed diurnally, as in evapotranspiration and infiltration, exhibit substantial differences in the timing, relative magnitude, and shape of their diurnal flow variations. Snowmelt-dominated rivers achieve their highest sustained flow and largest diurnal fluctuations during the spring melt season. These fluctuations are characterized by sharp rises and gradual declines in discharge each day. In large snowmelt-dominated basins, at the end of the melt season, the hour of maximum discharge shifts to later in the day as the snow line retreats to higher elevations.

abstract = {The temperature sensitivity (Q10) of soil heterotrophic respiration (Rh) is an important ecological model parameter and may vary with temperature and moisture. While Q10 generally decreases with increasing temperature, the moisture effects on Q10 have been controversial. To address this, we conducted a 90-day laboratory incubation experiment using a subtropical forest soil with a full factorial combination of five moisture levels (20{\%}, 40{\%}, 60{\%}, 80{\%}, and 100{\%} water holding capacity--WHC) and five temperature levels (10, 17, 24, 31, and 38°C). Under each moisture treatment, Rh was measured several times for each temperature treatment to derive Q10 based on the exponential relationships between Rh and temperature. Microbial biomass carbon (MBC), microbial community structure and soil nutrients were also measured several times to detect their potential contributions to the moisture-induced Q10 variation. We found that Q10 was significantly lower at lower moisture levels (60{\%}, 40{\%} and 20{\%} WHC) than at higher moisture level (80{\%} WHC) during the early stage of the incubation, but became significantly higher at 20{\%}WHC than at 60{\%} WHC and not significantly different from the other three moisture levels during the late stage of incubation. In contrast, soil Rh had the highest value at 60{\%} WHC and the lowest at 20{\%} WHC throughout the whole incubation period. Variations of Q10 were significantly associated with MBC during the early stages of incubation, but with the fungi-to-bacteria ratio during the later stages, suggesting that changes in microbial biomass and community structure are related to the moisture-induced Q10 changes. This study implies that global warming's impacts on soil CO2 emission may depend upon soil moisture conditions. With the same temperature rise, wetter soils may emit more CO2 into the atmosphere via heterotrophic respiration.},

@article{Zeng2015a,
abstract = {Understanding the temporal variance of evapotranspiration (ET) at the catchment scale remains a challenging task, because ET variance results from the complex interactions among climate, soil, vegetation, groundwater and human activities. This study extends the framework for ET variance analysis of Koster and Suarez (1999) by incorporating the water balance and the Budyko hypothesis. ET variance is decomposed into the variance/covariance of precipitation, potential ET, and catchment storage change. The contributions to ET variance from those components are quantified by long-term climate conditions (i.e., precipitation and potential ET) and catchment properties through the Budyko equation. It is found that climate determines ET variance under cool-wet, hot-dry and hot-wet conditions; while both catchment storage change and climate together control ET variance under cool-dry conditions. Thus the major factors of ET variance can be categorized based on the conditions of climate and catchment storage change. To demonstrate the analysis, both the inter- and intra-annul ET variances are assessed in the Murray-Darling Basin, and it is found that the framework corrects the over-estimation of ET variance in the arid basin. This study provides an extended theoretical framework to assess ET temporal variance under the impacts from both climate and storage change at the catchment scale.},

A total of 12 different one-dimensional cases were considered (saturated, unsaturated, layered and uniform soil profiles, with pressure and fluz type boundary conditions). The results show that the new method offers excellent CPU efficiency and, unlike the h-based method, is numerically robust for all cases of variably saturated, heterogeneous media, and first or second type boundary conditions. The method does not require difficult numerical coding, and its CPU efficiency is not affected by complicated heterogeneous and hysteretic media. The P{\_}{\{}t{\}} transformation is easy to incorporate into existing h-based codes.},

In this paper we develop an optimization algorithm that can be used for different studies related to climate change and water resources management. Three applications of this algorithm are developed for the Merced River basin. The first of these gives an assessment of the climate change effects on the operations of this basin considering an adaptive management strategy embedded in the optimization algorithm. In a second application we explore different long-term adaptation strategies intended to mitigate the effects of climate change. A final application is developed to determine how beneficial it is to build a new reservoir considering explicitly the uncertainty about future climate projections.},

In a second application we explore different long-term adaptation strategies intended to mitigate the effects of climate change. A final application is developed to determine how beneficial it is to build a new reservoir considering explicitly the uncertainty about future climate projections.},

@article{Wallach1997,
abstract = {Many simplifications are used in modeling surface runoff over a uniform
slope. A very common simplification is to determine the infiltration
rate independent of the overland flow depth and to combine it afterward
with the kinematic-wave equation to determine the overland flow depth.
Another simplication is to replace the spatially variable infiltration
rates along the slope i(x, t) due to the water depth variations h(x,t)
with an infiltration rate that is determined at a certain location
along the slope. The aim of this study is to evaluate the errors
induced by these simplications on predicted infiltration rates, overland
flow depths, and total runoff volume. The error analysis is accomplished
by comparing a simplified model with a model where the interaction
between the overland flow depth and infiltration rate is counted.
In this model, the infiltration rate is assumed to vary along the
slope with the overland flow depth, even for homogeneous soil profiles.
The kinematic-wave equation with interactive infiltration rate, calculated
along the slopy by Richard's equation, are then solved by a finite
difference scheme for a 100-m-long uniform slope. In the first error
analysis, we study the effect of combining an 'exact' and 'approximate'
one-dimensional infiltration rate with the kinematic-wave equation
for three different soil surface roughness coefficients. The terms
'exact' and 'approximate' stand for the solution of Richard's equation
with and without using the overland flow depth in the boundary condition,
respectively. The simulations showed that higher infiltration rates
and lower overland flow depths are obtained during the rising stage
of the hydrograph when overland flow depth is used in the upper boundary
condition of the one-dimensional Richard's equation. During the recession
period, the simplified model predicts lower infiltration rates and
higher overland flow depths. The absolute relative errors between
the 'exact' and 'approximate' solutions are positively correlated
to the overland flow depths which increase with the soil surface
roughness coefficient. For this error analysis, the relative errors
in surface runoff volume per unit slope width throughout the storm
are much smaller than the relative errors in momentary overland flow
depths and discharges due to the alternate signs of the deviations
along the rising and falling stages. In the second error analysis,
when the spatially variable infiltration rate along the slope i(x,
t) is replaced in the kinematic-wave equation by i(t), calculated
at the slope outlet, the overland flow depth is underestimated during
the rising stage of the hydrograph and overestimated during the falling
stage. The deviations during the rising stage are much smaller than
the deviations during the falling stage, but they are of a longer
duration. This occurs because the solution with i(x, t) recognizes
that part of the slope becomes dry after rainfall stops, while overland
flow still exists with i(t) determined at the slope outlet. As obtained
for the first error analysis, the relative errors in surface runoff
volume per unit slope width are also much smaller than the relative
errors in momentary overland flow depths and discharges. The relation
between the errors in overland flow depth and discharge to different
mathematical simplifications enables to evaluate whether certain
simplifications are justified or more computational efforts should
be used.},

abstract = {Projecting the impacts of climate change on agriculture requires knowing or assuming how farmers will adapt. However, empirical estimates of the effectiveness of this private adaptation are scarce and the sensitivity of impact assessments to adaptation assumptions is not well understood 1,2. Here we assess the potential effectiveness of private farmer adaptation in Europe by jointly estimating both short-run and long-run response functions using time-series and cross-sectional variation in subnational yield and profit data. The difference between the impacts of climate change projected using the short-run (limited adaptation) and long-run (substantial adaptation) response curves can be interpreted as the private adaptation potential. We find high adaptation potential for maize to future warming but large negative effects and only limited adaptation potential for wheat and barley. Overall, agricultural profits could increase slightly under climate change if farmers adapt but could decrease in many areas if there is no adaptation. Decomposing the variance in 2040 projected yields and farm profits using an ensemble of 13 climate model runs, we find that the rate at which farmers will adapt to rising temperatures is an important source of uncertainty.},

abstract = {Soil profiles are often many meters deep, but with the majority of studies in soil microbiology focusing exclusively on the soil surface, we know very little about the nature of the microbial communities inhabiting the deeper soil horizons. We used phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis to examine the vertical distribution of specific microbial groups and to identify the patterns of microbial abundance and community-level diversity within the soil profile. Samples were collected from the soil surface down to 2m in depth from two unsaturated Mollisol profiles located near Santa Barbara, CA, USA. While the densities of microorganisms were generally one to two orders of magnitude lower in the deeper horizons of both profiles than at the soil surface, approximately 35{\%} of the total quantity of microbial biomass found in the top 2m of soil is found below a depth of 25cm. Principal components analysis of the PLFA signatures indicates that the composition of the soil microbial communities changes significantly with soil depth. The differentiation of microbial communities within the two profiles coincides with an overall decline in microbial diversity. The number of individual PLFAs detected in soil samples decreased by about a third from the soil surface down to 2m. The ratios of cyclopropyl/monoenoic precursors and total saturated/total monounsaturated fatty acids increased with soil depth, suggesting that the microbes inhabiting the deeper soil horizons are more carbon limited than surface-dwelling microbes. Using PLFAs as biomarkers, we show that Gram-positive bacteria and actinomycetes tended to increase in proportional abundance with increasing soil depth, while the abundances of Gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and protozoa were highest at the soil surface and substantially lower in the subsurface.

abstract = {For practical problems, efficient but accurate solution methods are
usually preferred to computationally expensive but extremely accurate
ones. The Muskingum-Cunge (M-C) method is an efficient technique
often applied to solve flood routing problems. There are two free
parameters in the M-C method: the spatial step and the temporal step.
The accuracy of the method wholly depends on the Courant number (essentially
the ratio of these step sizes). It is not known which combination
of spatial and temporal step yields the best solution. In this study,
the concept of column holdup (which is quite often employed in solute
transport problems) and the results from the truncation error analysis
of the kinematic wave equation are combined to obtain a straightforward
condition leading to optimal spatial and temporal steps. It is found
that a simple explicit scheme is the best method to solve the complete
diffusion wave equation starting from the kinematic wave equation.
The scheme attains third-order accuracy if the optimal Courant number
is 1/2.},

@article{Sivakumar2007,
abstract = {Technological advances, by facilitating extensive data collection, better data sharing, formulation of sophisticated methods, and development of complex models, have brought hydrologic research to a whole new level. Despite these obvious advances, there are also concerns about their general use in practice. On the one hand, it is natural to develop more complex models than perhaps needed (i.e. representations having too many parameters and requiring too much data); on the other hand, it is often difficult to 'translate' results from one specific situation to another. Recent studies have addressed these concerns, albeit in different forms, such as dominant processes, thresholds, model integration, and model simplification. A common aspect in, some of these studies is that they recognize the need for a globally agreed upon 'classification system' in hydrology. The present study explores this classification issue further from a simple phase-space data reconstruction perspective. The reconstruction involves representation of the given multidimensional hydrologic system using only an available single-variable series through a delay coordinate procedure. The 'extent of complexity' of the system (defined especially in the context of variability of relevant data) is identified by the 'region of attraction of trajectories' in the phase space, which is then used to classify the system as potentially low-, medium- or high-dimensional. A host of river-related data, representing different geographic and climatic regions, temporal scales, and processes, are studied. Yielding 'attractors' that range from 'very clear' ones to 'very blurred' ones, depending on data, the results indicate the usefulness of this simple reconstruction concept for studying hydrologic system complexity and classification.

abstract = {Place-based data is required in wildfire analyses, particularly in regions of diverse terrain that foster not only strong gradients in meteorological variables, but also complex fire behaviour. However, a majority of downscaling methods are inappropriate for wildfire application due to the lack of daily timescales and variables such as humidity and winds that are important for fuel flammability and fire spread. Two statistical downscaling methods, the daily Bias corrected Spatial Downscaling (BCSD) and the Multivariate Adapted Constructed Analogs (MACA) that directly incorporate daily data from global climate models, were validated over the western US using global reanalysis data. While both methods outperformed results obtained from direct interpolation from reanalysis, MACA exhibited additional skill in temperature, humidity, wind, and precipitation due to its ability to jointly downscale temperature and dew point temperature, and its use of analog patterns rather than interpolation. Both downscaling methods exhibited value added information in tracking fire danger indices and periods of extreme fire danger; however, MACA outperformed the daily BCSD due to its ability to more accurately capture relative humidity and winds.

abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) use spatial environmental data to make inferences on species' range limits and habitat suitability. Conceptually, these models aim to determine and map components of a species' ecological niche through space and time, and they have become important tools in pure and applied ecology and evolutionary biology. Most approaches are correlative in that they statistically link spatial data to species distribution records. An alternative strategy is to explicitly incorporate the mechanistic links between the functional traits of organisms and their environments into SDMs. Here, we review how the principles of biophysical ecology can be used to link spatial data to the physiological responses and constraints of organisms. This provides a mechanistic view of the fundamental niche which can then be mapped to the landscape to infer range constraints. We show how physiologically based SDMs can be developed for different organisms in different environmental contexts. Mechanistic SDMs have different strengths and weaknesses to correlative approaches, and there are many exciting and unexplored prospects for integrating the two approaches. As physiological knowledge becomes better integrated into SDMs, we will make more robust predictions of range shifts in novel or non-equilibrium contexts such as invasions, translocations, climate change and evolutionary shifts.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. Detecting long-term change in seasonal precipitation using ground observations is dependent on the representativity of the point measurement to the surrounding landscape. In mountainous regions, representativity can be poor and lead to large uncertainties in precipitation estimates at high elevations or in areas where observations are sparse. If the uncertainty in the estimate is large compared to the long-term shifts in precipitation, then the change will likely go undetected. In this analysis, we examine the minimum detectable change across mountainous terrain in western Montana, USA. We ask the question: What is the minimum amount of change that is necessary to be detected using our best estimates of precipitation in complex terrain? We evaluate the spatial uncertainty in the precipitation estimates by conditioning historic regional climate model simulations to ground observations using Bayesian inference. By using this uncertainty as a null hypothesis, we test for detectability across the study region. To provide context for the detectability calculations, we look at a range of future scenarios from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) multimodel ensemble downscaled to 4 km resolution using the MACAv2-METDATA data set. When using the ensemble averages we find that approximately 65{\%} of the significant increases in winter precipitation go undetected at midelevations. At high elevation, approximately 75{\%} of significant increases in winter precipitation are undetectable. Areas where change can be detected are largely controlled by topographic features. Elevation and aspect are key characteristics that determine whether or not changes in winter precipitation can be detected. Furthermore, we find that undetected increases in winter precipitation at high elevation will likely remain as snow under climate change scenarios. Therefore, there is potential for these areas to offset snowpack loss at lower elevations and confound the effects of climate change on water resources.},

abstract = {The relationship between seasonal agricultural drought and detrended yields (within a period from 1961 to 2000) of selected crops was assessed in the conditions of the Czech Republic, which are to some extent representative of a wider area of Central Europe. Impact of water stress was analyzed using time series of yields for 8 crops (spring barley, winter wheat, grain maize, potato, winter rape, oats, winter rye and hay from permanent meadows) for 77 districts in the Czech Republic (average district area is 1025 km2). Relative version of Palmer's Z-index (rZ-index or rZ-i) was used as a tool for quantification of agricultural drought. The monthly values of the rZ-index for each individual district were calculated as the spatial average (only for the grids of arable land). The study showed that severe droughts (e.g., in 1981 and 2000) are linked with significant reduction in yields of the main cereals and majority of other crops through the most drought prone regions. We found a statistically significant correlation (p ≤ 0.05) between the sum of the rZ-index for the main growing period of each crop and the yield departures of spring barley within 81{\%} (winter wheat in 57{\%}, maize in 48{\%}, potato in 89{\%}, oats in 79{\%}, winter rye in 52{\%}, rape in 39{\%}, hay in 79{\%}) of the analyzed districts. This study also defined the crop-specific thresholds under which a soil moisture deficit (expressed in terms of rZ-index) leads to severe impact at the district level. This can be expressed as the sum of the monthly rZ-index during the period of high crop sensitivity to drought; for spring barley it is -5, winter wheat -5, maize -9, rape -12, winter rye -10, oat -4, potato -6 and for hay -3. The length of the sensitive period is also crop-specific and includes the months that are important for the yield formation. The results show that yields of spring barley (and spring crops in general) are significantly more affected by seasonal water stress than yields of winter crops and hay from permanent meadows. The study proved that a severe drought spell during the sensitive period of vegetative season does have a quantifiable negative effect, even within more humid regions. These results demonstrate that, at least in some areas of the CR (and probably most of Central Europe), drought is one of the key causes of interannual yield variability. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we have further improved the ET algorithm in Mu et al. (2007a, hereafter called old algorithm) by 1) simplifying the calculation of vegetation cover fraction; 2) calculating ET as the sum of daytime and nighttime components; 3) adding soil heat flux calculation; 4) improving estimates of stomatal conductance, aerodynamic resistance and boundary layer resistance; 5) separating dry canopy surface from the wet; and 6) dividing soil surface into saturated wet surface and moist surface. We compared the improved algorithm with the old one both globally and locally at 46 eddy flux towers. The global annual total ET over the vegetated land surface is 62.8×103km3, agrees very well with other reported estimates of 65.5×103km3 over the terrestrial land surface, which is much higher than 45.8×103km3 estimated with the old algorithm. For ET evaluation at eddy flux towers, the improved algorithm reduces mean absolute bias (MAE) of daily ET from 0.39mm day−1 to 0.33mmday−1 driven by tower meteorological data, and from 0.40mmday−1 to 0.31mmday−1 driven by GMAO data, a global meteorological reanalysis dataset. MAE values by the improved ET algorithm are 24.6{\%} and 24.1{\%} of the ET measured from towers, within the range (10–30{\%}) of the reported uncertainties in ET measurements, implying an enhanced accuracy of the improved algorithm. Compared to the old algorithm, the improved algorithm increases the skill score with tower-driven ET estimates from 0.50 to 0.55, and from 0.46 to 0.53 with GMAO-driven ET. Based on these results, the improved ET algorithm has a better performance in generating global ET data products, providing critical information on global terrestrial water and energy cycles and environmental changes.},

abstract = {{\textless}abstract abstract-type="summary"{\textgreater} The objective of this analysis was to use a simple, mechanistic crop growth model to examine the effects of variation in solar radiation and temperature on potential maize (Zea mays L.) yield among locations. Crop phenology and leaf growth were calculated from daily mean temperature data obtained at the five locations studied. Daily biomass accumulation was calculated by estimating the amount of radiation intercepted and assuming maximum crop radiation use efficiency of 1.6 g MJ-1. Grain yield accumulation was simulated using a linear increase in harvest index during grain filling. Observed and simulated grain yields were compared for several sowings at each of five localions ranging from latitude 14°S to 40°N lat. Averaged across sowings, respective observed and simulated oven-dry grain yields (g m-2) were 816 and 830 at Katherine, Australia; 953 and 908 at Gainesville, FL; 1059 and 1106 at Quincy, FL; 1091 and 1119 at Champaign, IL; and 1580 and 1626 at Grand Junction, CO. Temperature primarily affected growth duration with lower temperature increasing the length of time that the crop could intercept radiation. The solar radiation response was related to the amount of incident radiation and to the fraction of radiation intercepted by the crop. In the tropics (Katherine), high temperature decreased the duration of growth and grain yield, despite high levels of radiation. Only at locations with low temperature and consequent long growth duration. and with high radiation were maize yields simulated to be more than 1600 g m-2 (300 bushels per acre at 15.5{\%} moisture). {\textless}fn id="FN1" fn-type="other"{\textgreater}Florida Agric.

abstract = {Soil respiration (Rs) is a major pathway by which fixed carbon in the biosphere is returned to the atmosphere, yet there are limits to our ability to predict respiration rates using environmental drivers at the global scale. While temperature, moisture, carbon supply and other site characteristics are known to regulate soil respiration rates at plot scales within certain biomes, quantitative frameworks for evaluating the relative importance of these factors across different biomes and at the global scale require tests of the relationships between field estimates and global climatic data. This study evaluates the factors driving Rs at the global scale by linking global datasets of soil moisture, soil temperature, primary productivity and soil carbon estimates with observations of annual Rs from the Global Soil Respiration Database (SRDB). We find that calibrating models with parabolic soil moisture functions can improve predictive power over similar models with asymptotic functions of mean annual precipitation. Soil temperature is comparable with previously-reported air temperature observations used in predicting Rs, and is the dominant driver of Rs in global models; however, within certain biomes soil moisture or soil carbon emerge as dominant predictors of Rs. We identify regions where typical temperature-driven responses are further mediated by soil moisture, precipitation, and carbon supply and regions in which environmental controls on high Rs values are difficult to ascertain due to limited field data. Because soil moisture integrates temperature and precipitation dynamics, it can more directly constrain the heterotrophic component of Rs, but global-scale models tend to smooth its spatial heterogeneity by aggregating factors that increase moisture variability within and across biomes. We compare statistical and mechanistic models that provide independent estimates of global Rs ranging from 83 to 108 Pg/yr, but also highlight regions of uncertainty where more observations are required or environmental controls are hard to constrain.},

abstract = {A new version of the ecosystem process model FOREST-BGC is presented that uses stand water and nitrogen limitations to alter the leaf/root/stem carbon allocation fraction dynamically at each annual iteration. Water deficit is defined by integrating a daily soil water deficit fraction annually. Current nitrogen limitation is defined relative to a hypothetical optimum foliar N pool, computed as maximum leaf area index multiplied by maximum leaf nitrogen concentration. Decreasing availability of water or nitrogen, or both, reduces the leaf/root carbon partitioning ratio. Leaf and root N concentrations, and maximum leaf photosynthetic capacity are also redefined annually as functions of nitrogen availability. Test simulations for hypothetical coniferous forests were performed for Madison, WI and Missoula, MT, and showed simulated leaf area index ranging from 4.5 for a control stand at Missoula, to 11 for a fertilized stand at Madison, with Year 50 stem carbon biomasses of 31 and 128 Mg ha(-1), respectively.

abstract = {The reduction of soil moisture content during droughts lowers the plant water potential and decreases transpiration; this in turn causes a reduction of cell turgor and relative water content which brings about a sequence of damages of increasing seriousness. A review of the literature on plant physiology and water stress shows that vegetation water stress can be assumed to start at the soil moisture level corresponding to incipient stomatal closure and reach a maximum intensity at the wilting point. The mean crossing properties of these soil moisture levels crucial for water stress are derived analytically for the stochastic model of soil moisture dynamics described in Part II (F. Laio, A. Porporato, L. Ridolfi, I. Rodriguez-Iturbe. Adv. Water Res. 24 (7) (2001) 707–723). These properties are then used to propose a measure of vegetation water stress which combines the mean intensity, duration, and frequency of periods of soil water deficit. The characteristics of vegetation water stress are then studied under different climatic conditions, showing how the interplay between plant, soil, and environment can lead to optimal conditions for vegetation.},

Recently, various BEFMs have been developed, often for one purpose or location, but hardly any of these models are re-used later for other purposes or locations. The Farm System Simulator (FSSIM) provides a generic framework enabling the application of BEFMs under various situations and for different purposes (generating supply response functions and detailed regional or farm type assessments). FSSIM is set up as a component-based framework with components representing farmer objectives, risk, calibration, policies, current activities, alternative activities and different types of activities (e.g., annual and perennial cropping and livestock). The generic nature of FSSIM is evaluated using five criteria by examining its applications. FSSIM has been applied for different climate zones and soil types (criterion 1) and to a range of different farm types (criterion 2) with different specializations, intensities and sizes. In most applications FSSIM has been used to assess the effects of policy changes and in two applications to assess the impact of technological innovations (criterion 3). In the various applications, different data sources, level of detail (e.g., criterion 4) and model configurations have been used. FSSIM has been linked to an economic and several biophysical models (criterion 5). The model is available for applications to other conditions and research issues, and it is open to be further tested and to be extended with new components, indicators or linkages to other models.},

abstract = {Reducing poverty in rural areas of developing countries requires sustained and sustainable increases in agricultural water productivity. However, aside from traditional measures of precipitation, little is known about water available to farmers or how productively they use it. We present a crop-water productivity index (a ratio of the value of annual crop production to a dimensionless potential water availability index) for large water basins using readily available low-resolution data. The index is transferable, permits direct inter-basin comparisons, and is simple to calculate. We calculate the index for each municipality in the S{\~{a}}o Francisco river basin in Brazil. No clear patterns linking water availability and value of agricultural output are evident, even though clusters of munic{\'{i}}pios with high- and low-crop-water productivity emerge, and the former may be useful in guiding policies aimed at increasing water productivity. Finally, analyses of the effects of information uncertainty on the crop-water productivity index suggest that the returns to agricultural investments in certain places in the S{\~{a}}o Francisco river basin are more risky than others. Improvements in data quality and quantity can help refine estimates of the index and reduce their uncertainty. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Author.

abstract = {This study investigates trends in the timing and magnitude of seasonal maximum flood events across Canada. A new methodology for analyzing trends in the timing of flood events is developed that takes into account the directional character and multi-modality of flood occurrences. The methodology transforms the directional series of flood occurrences into new series by defining a new location of the origin. A test of flood seasonality (multi-modality) is then applied to identify dominant flood seasons. Floods from the dominant seasons are analyzed separately by a seasonal trend analysis. The Mann-Kendall test in conjunction with the method of pre-whitening is used in the trend analysis. Over 160 streamflow records from one common observation period are analyzed in watersheds with relatively pristine and stable land-use conditions. The results show weak signals of climate variability and/or change present in the timing of floods in Canada during the last three decades. Most of the significant trends in the timing of spring snowmelt floods are negative trends (earlier flood occurrence) found in the southern part of Canada. There are no significant trends identified in the timing of fall rainfall floods. However, the significance of the fall, rainfall-dominated flood season has been increasing in several analyzed watersheds. This may indicate increasing intensity of rainfall events during the recent years. Trends in the magnitude of floods are more pronounced than the trends in the timing of floods. Almost one fifth of all the analyzed stations show significant trends in the magnitude of snowmelt floods. Most of the significant trends are negative trends, suggesting decreasing magnitudes of snowmelt floods in Canada over the last three decades. Significant negative trends are found particularly in southern Ontario, northern Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia. There are no significant trends in the magnitude of rainfall floods found in the analyzed streamflow records. The results support the outcomes of previous streamflow trend studies conducted in Canada. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The Mann-Kendall test in conjunction with the method of pre-whitening is used in the trend analysis. Over 160 streamflow records from one common observation period are analyzed in watersheds with relatively pristine and stable land-use conditions. The results show weak signals of climate variability and/or change present in the timing of floods in Canada during the last three decades. Most of the significant trends in the timing of spring snowmelt floods are negative trends (earlier flood occurrence) found in the southern part of Canada. There are no significant trends identified in the timing of fall rainfall floods. However, the significance of the fall, rainfall-dominated flood season has been increasing in several analyzed watersheds. This may indicate increasing intensity of rainfall events during the recent years. Trends in the magnitude of floods are more pronounced than the trends in the timing of floods. Almost one fifth of all the analyzed stations show significant trends in the magnitude of snowmelt floods. Most of the significant trends are negative trends, suggesting decreasing magnitudes of snowmelt floods in Canada over the last three decades. Significant negative trends are found particularly in southern Ontario, northern Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia. There are no significant trends in the magnitude of rainfall floods found in the analyzed streamflow records. The results support the outcomes of previous streamflow trend studies conducted in Canada. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.


This study investigates trends in the timing and magnitude of seasonal maximum flood events across Canada. A new methodology for analyzing trends in the timing of flood events is developed that takes into account the directional character and multi-modality of flood occurrences. The methodology transforms the directional series of flood occurrences into new series by defining a new location of the origin. A test of flood seasonality (multi-modality) is then applied to identify dominant flood seasons. Floods from the dominant seasons are analyzed separately by a seasonal trend analysis.

@article{Rempe2018,
abstract = {Recent theory and field observations suggest that a systematically varying weathering zone, that can be tens of meters thick, commonly develops in the bedrock underlying hillslopes. Weathering turns otherwise poorly conductive bedrock into a dynamic water storage reservoir. Infiltrating precipitation typically will pass through unsaturated weathered bedrock before reaching groundwater and running off to streams. This invisible and difficult to access unsaturated zone is virtually unexplored compared with the surface soil mantle. We have proposed the term "rock moisture" to describe the exchangeable water stored in the unsaturated zone in weathered bedrock, purposely choosing a term parallel to, but distinct from, soil moisture, because weathered bedrock is a distinctly different material that is distributed across landscapes independently of soil thickness. Here, we report a multiyear intensive campaign of quantifying rock moisture across a hillslope underlain by a thick weathered bedrock zone using repeat neutron probe measurements in a suite of boreholes. Rock moisture storage accumulates in the wet season, reaches a characteristic upper value, and rapidly passes any additional rainfall downward to groundwater. Hence, rock moisture storage mediates the initiation and magnitude of recharge and runoff. In the dry season, rock moisture storage is gradually depleted by trees for transpiration, leading to a common lower value at the end of the dry season. Up to 27{\%} of the annual rainfall is seasonally stored as rock moisture. Significant rock moisture storage is likely common, and yet it is missing from hydrologic and land-surface models used to predict regional and global climate.},

abstract = {Ecosystem water-use efficiency (eWUE; the ratio of net ecosystem productivity to evapotranspiration rate) is a complex landscape-scale parameter controlled by both physical and biological processes occurring in soil and plants. Leaf WUE (lWUE; the ratio of leaf CO(2) assimilation rate to transpiration rate) is controlled at short time scales principally by leaf stomatal dynamics and this control varies among plant species. Little is known about how leaf-scale variation in lWUE influences landscape-scale variation in eWUE. We analyzed approximately seven thousand 30-min averaged eddy covariance observations distributed across 9 years in order to assess eWUE in two neighboring forest communities. Mean eWUE was 19{\%} lower for the community in which Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir were dominant, compared to the community in which lodgepole pine was dominant. Of that 19{\%} difference, 8{\%} was attributed to residual bias in the analysis that favored periods with slightly drier winds for the spruce-fir community. In an effort to explain the remaining 11{\%} difference, we assessed patterns in lWUE using C isotope ratios. When we focused on bulk tissue from older needles we detected significant differences in lWUE among tree species and between upper and lower canopy needles. However, when these differences were scaled to reflect vertical and horizontal leaf area distributions within the two communities, they provided no power to explain differences in eWUE that we observed in the eddy covariance data. When we focused only on bulk needle tissue of current-year needles for 3 of the 9 years, we also observed differences in lWUE among species and in needles from upper and lower parts of the canopy. When these differences in lWUE were scaled to reflect leaf area distributions within the two communities, we were able to explain 6.3{\%} of the differences in eWUE in 1 year (2006), but there was no power to explain differences in the other 2 years (2003 and 2007). When we examined sugars extracted from needles at 3 different times during the growing season of 2007, we could explain 3.8-6.0{\%} of the differences in eWUE between the two communities, but the difference in eWUE obtained from the eddy covariance record, and averaged over the growing season for this single year, was 32{\%}. Thus, overall, after accounting for species effects on lWUE, we could explain little of the difference in eWUE between the two forest communities observed in the eddy covariance record. It is likely that water and C fluxes from soil, understory plants, and non-needle tissues, account for most of the differences observed in the eddy covariance data. For those cases where we could explain some of the difference in eWUE on the basis of species effects, we partitioned the scaled patterns in lWUE into two components: a component that is independent of canopy leaf area distribution, and therefore only dependent on species-specific differences in needle physiology; and a component that is independent of species differences in needle physiology, and only dependent on species-specific influences on canopy leaf area distribution. Only the component that is dependent on species influences on canopy leaf area distribution, and independent of inherent species differences in needle physiology, had potential to explain differences in eWUE between the two communities. Thus, when tree species effects are important, canopy structure, rather than species-specific needle physiology, has more potential to explain patterns in eWUE.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Anthropogenic climate change is projected to enrich the atmosphere with carbon dioxide, change vegetation dynamics and influence the availability of water at the catchment scale. This study combines a nonlinear model for estimating changes in leaf area index (LAI) due to climatic fluctuations with the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) hydrological model to improve catchment streamflow prediction under a changing climate. The combined model was applied to 13 gauged sub-catchments with different land cover types (crop, pasture and tree) in the Goulburn–Broken catchment, Australia, for the "Millennium Drought" (1997–2009) relative to the period 1983–1995, and for two future periods (2021–2050 and 2071–2100) and two emission scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP8.5) which were compared with the baseline historical period of 1981–2010. This region was projected to be warmer and mostly drier in the future as predicted by 38 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) runs from 15 global climate models (GCMs) and for two emission scenarios. The results showed that during the Millennium Drought there was about a 29.7–66.3 {\%} reduction in mean annual runoff due to reduced precipitation and increased temperature. When drought-induced changes in LAI were included, smaller reductions in mean annual runoff of between 29.3 and 61.4 {\%} were predicted. The proportional increase in runoff due to modeling LAI was 1.3–10.2 {\%} relative to not including LAI. For projected climate change under the RCP4.5 emission scenario, ignoring the LAI response to changing climate could lead to a further reduction in mean annual runoff of between 2.3 and 27.7 {\%} in the near-term (2021–2050) and 2.3 to 23.1 {\%} later in the century (2071–2100) relative to modeling the dynamic response of LAI to precipitation and temperature changes. Similar results (near-term 2.5–25.9 {\%} and end of century 2.6–24.2 {\%}) were found for climate change under the RCP8.5 emission scenario. Incorporating climate-induced changes in LAI in the VIC model reduced the projected declines in streamflow and confirms the importance of including the effects of changes in LAI in future projections of streamflow.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Via air temperature increases and relative humidity changes, climate change will modify vapor pressure deficit (VPD), which is an important determinant of water vapor and CO 2 exchange between the land surface and atmosphere. VPD is the difference between the water vapor the air can hold at saturation (e s) and the actual amount of water vapor (e a). Here we assess changes in VPD, e s , and e a in the United States (U.S.) for the recent past (1979–2013) and the future (2065–2099) using gridded, observed climate data and output from general circulation models. Historically, VPD has increased for all seasons, driven by increases in e s and declines in e a . The spring, summer, and fall seasons exhibited the largest areal extent of significant increases in VPD, which was largely concentrated in the western and southern portions of the U.S. The changes in VPD stemmed from recent air temperature increases and relative humidity decreases. Projections indicate similar, amplified patterns into the future. For the summer, the general circulation model ensemble median showed a 51{\%} projected increase (quartile range of 39 and 64{\%}) in summer VPD for the U.S., reflecting temperature-driven increases in e s but decreases or minimal changes in relative humidity that promotes negligible changes in e a . Using a simple model for plant hydraulic functioning, we also show that in the absence of stomatal acclimation, future changes in VPD can reduce stomatal conductance by 9–51{\%}, which is a magnitude comparable to the expected decline in stomatal conductance from rising CO 2 .},

abstract = {1. The relationship between stomatal conductance (gs) and leaf water potential ($\Psi$l) is key to the understanding of plant function under changing climate. The variability among tree species gave rise to selection towards either of two contrasting water management types: isohydric or anisohydric. This study explores the variability of gs to $\Psi$l across tree species. 2. Curves of gs($\Psi$l) were collected from the scientific literature for 70 woody plant species. The data set is comprised of angiosperm and gymnosperm species from all major forest bio- mes. The hypothesis that curves from different tree species diverge between isohydric and anisohydric behaviours was tested. 3. Species-specific curves formed a continuum, rather than dichotomy between isohydric and anisohydric, as confirmed by distribution models. Alternatively, the water potential at 50{\%} of the maximum gs ($\Psi$gs50) was used to quantitatively compare between species. A major differ- ence emerged among xylem anatomy classes whereby ring-porous species had higher absolute gs at $\Psi$l {\textless} {\`{A}}2 MPa than diffuse-porous and coniferous species. A positive, linear correlation was shown between $\Psi$gs50 and $\Psi$l at 50{\%} loss of xylem conductivity. 4. The results suggest that stomatal sensitivity to leaf water potential strongly relates to xylem characteristics. The use of $\Psi$gs50 offers a quantitative alternative to the current, yet biased, distinction between isohydric and anisohydric species.},

abstract = {There are pressing concerns about the interplay between agricultural productivity, water demand, and water availability in semi-arid to arid regions of the world. Currently, irrigated agriculture is the dominant water user in these regions and is estimated to consume approximately 80{\%} of the world's diverted freshwater resources. We develop an improved irrigated land-use mapping algorithm that uses the seasonal maximum value of a spectral index to distinguish between irrigated and non-irrigated parcels in Idaho's Snake River Plain. We compare this approach to two alternative algorithms that differentiate between irrigated and non-irrigated parcels using spectral index values at a single date or the area beneath spectral index trajectories for the duration of the agricultural growing season. Using six different pixel and county-scale error metrics, we evaluate the performance of these three algorithms across all possible combinations of two growing seasons (2002 and 2007), two datasets (MODIS and Landsat 5), and three spectral indices, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Enhanced Vegetation Index and Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDVI, EVI, and NDMI). We demonstrate that, on average, the seasonal-maximum algorithm yields an improvement in classification accuracy over the accepted single-date approach, and that the average improvement under this approach is a 60{\%} reduction in county scale root mean square error (RMSE), and modest improvements of overall accuracy in the pixel scale validation. The greater accuracy of the seasonal-maximum algorithm is primarily due to its ability to correctly classify non-irrigated lands in riparian and developed areas of the study region.},

@article{Hursh2017a,
abstract = {Soil respiration (Rs) is a major pathway by which fixed carbon in the biosphere is returned to the atmosphere, yet there are limits to our ability to predict respiration rates using environmental drivers at the global scale. While temperature, moisture, carbon supply, and other site characteristics are known to regulate soil respiration rates at plot scales within certain biomes, quantitative frameworks for evaluating the relative importance of these factors across different biomes and at the global scale require tests of the relationships between field estimates and global climatic data. This study evaluates the factors driving Rs at the global scale by linking global datasets of soil moisture, soil temperature, primary productivity, and soil carbon estimates with observations of annual Rs from the Global Soil Respiration Database (SRDB). We find that calibrating models with parabolic soil moisture functions can improve predictive power over similar models with asymptotic functions of mean annual precipitation. Soil temperature is comparable with previously reported air temperature observations used in predicting Rs and is the dominant driver of Rs in global models; however, within certain biomes soil moisture and soil carbon emerge as dominant predictors of Rs. We identify regions where typical temperature-driven responses are further mediated by soil moisture, precipitation, and carbon supply and regions in which environmental controls on high Rs values are difficult to ascertain due to limited field data. Because soil moisture integrates temperature and precipitation dynamics, it can more directly constrain the heterotrophic component of Rs, but global-scale models tend to smooth its spatial heterogeneity by aggregating factors that increase moisture variability within and across biomes. We compare statistical and mechanistic models that provide independent estimates of global Rs ranging from 83 to 108 Pg yr−1, but also highlight regions of uncertainty where more observations are required or environmental controls are hard to constrain.},

abstract = {We analysed the evolution of drought on the NW Iberian Peninsula from 1930 to 2006, and identified differences between the effects of precipitation variability and warming processes on drought severity and surface water resources. Two drought indices were used, one based on precipitation (the standardised precipitation index, SPI) and the other based on water balance, as reflected by the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, PET (the standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index, SPEI). The results show that precipitation has increased in the region, but a significant increase has also occurred in PET. No statistically significant differences were found over the study period for the severity of drought, as assessed by both the SPI and SPEI. In addition, although in the last 3 decades the mean duration of drought episodes has increased by approximately 1 mo as a consequence of the increase of the PET rates, the differences are not statistically significant. River discharge is mainly driven by precipitation variability, whereas warming processes did not have a noticeable influence on the streamflow variability between 1930 and 2006. The implications of global warming projected by global climate models on future drought severity and the availability of water resources are highly relevant in the near future. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2011.},

In our paper we developed an approach to measuring the impact of global warming on agriculture. We call this approach Ricardian because it relies upon standard rent theory as a way of identifying the impact of changes on net economic welfare. We compared the Ricardian approach with the traditional production-function approach, which uses agricultural production functions but has great difficulty identifying all the other adjustments that farmers make in response to changing external conditions. The Ricardian approach is particularly well-suited to a tremendously heterogenous sector because it can rely upon reduced-form estimation and does not require the impossible task of constructing structural models of hundreds of crops in thousands of locations. Our Ricardian approach assumes that the existing pattern of agricultural land rents and land prices reflects the long-run equilibrium economic effect of climate and other geophysical and economic variables. Standard economic reasoning shows that, by calculating the estimated effects of perturbing the climatic variables, we can project the impact of climate change on economic welfare.},

abstract = {*Understanding controls over plant-atmosphere CO(2) exchange is important for quantifying carbon budgets across a range of spatial and temporal scales. In this study, we used a simple approach to estimate whole-tree CO(2) assimilation rate (A(Tree)) in a subalpine forest ecosystem. *We analysed the carbon isotope ratio (delta(13)C) of extracted needle sugars and combined it with the daytime leaf-to-air vapor pressure deficit to estimate tree water-use efficiency (WUE). The estimated WUE was then combined with observations of tree transpiration rate (E) using sap flow techniques to estimate A(Tree). Estimates of A(Tree) for the three dominant tree species in the forest were combined with species distribution and tree size to estimate and gross primary productivity (GPP) using an ecosystem process model. *A sensitivity analysis showed that estimates of A(Tree) were more sensitive to dynamics in E than delta(13)C. At the ecosystem scale, the abundance of lodgepole pine trees influenced seasonal dynamics in GPP considerably more than Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir because of its greater sensitivity of E to seasonal climate variation. *The results provide the framework for a nondestructive method for estimating whole-tree carbon assimilation rate and ecosystem GPP over daily-to weekly time scales.},

abstract = {The profile characteristics and the temporal dynamics of soil moisture
variation were studied at 26 locations in Da Nangou catchment (3.5 km2)
in the loess area of China. Soil moisture measurements were performed
biweekly at five depths in the soil profile (0-5, 10-15, 20-25, 40-45
and 70-75 cm) from May to October 1998 using Delta-T theta probe.
Soil moisture profile type and temporal variation type and their
relationship to topography and land use were identified by detrended
canonical correspondence analysis (DCCA) and correlation analysis.
The profile distribution of time-averaged soil moisture content can
be classified into three types i.e. decreasing-type, waving-type
and increasing-type. The profile features of soil moisture (e.g.
profile gradient and profile variability) are influenced by different
environmental factors. The profile type of soil moisture is only
attributed to land use while profile gradient and profile variability
of soil moisture is mainly related to land use and topography (e.g.
landform type and slope). The temporal dynamics of layer-averaged
soil moisture content is grouped into three types including three-peak
type, synchro-four-peak type and lagged-four-peak type. These types
are controlled by topography rather than by land use. The temporal
dynamic type of soil moisture shows significant correlation with
relative elevation, slope, aspect, while temporal variance displays
significant relation with slope shape. The mean soil moisture is
related to both the profile and dynamics features of soil moisture
and is controlled by both land use and topography (e.g. aspect, position,
slope and relative elevation). The spatial variability of soil moisture
across landscape varies with both soil depths and temporal evolution.},

PRISM exhibited the lowest cross-validation bias and absolute error when compared to kriging, detrended kriging, and cokriging in the Willamette River basin, Oregon. PRISM was also applied to northern Oregon and to the entire western United States; detrended kriging and cokriging could not be used, because there was no overall relationship between elevation and precipitation.

abstract = {Pentraxin-3 (PTX3) is an acute phase reactant produced by a variety of cell types at sites of local inflammation. We examined by immunohistochemistry renal biopsies from patients with acute rejection (n = 10), protocol biopsies without rejection (n = 37), and peri-operative donor biopsies of the same transplant patients (n = 94) for intra-renal expression of PTX3, and its correlation with clinical, laboratory, and histopathologic parameters. PTX3 was mainly expressed in the interstitium of renal allograft. In the non-rejection biopsies (pre- and post-reperfusion and protocol biopsies), PTX3 expression area (PTX3{\%}) was equally maintained at a low level, whereas in the rejection biopsies, PTX3{\%} was significantly higher (p {\textless} 0.0001). Treatment of acute rejection resulted in a significant reduction of PTX3{\%} (p {\textless} 0.0001). PTX3{\%} positively correlated with the degree of allograft dysfunction and acute rejection scores of Banff classification (2009). This study suggests that PTX3{\%} may be an available histological marker of acute renal allograft rejection.},

abstract = {We studied the distribution of the indigenous bacterial and fungal communities in a forest soil profile. The composition of bacterial and fungal communities was assessed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of total and extracellular DNA extracted from all the soil horizons. Microbial biomass C and basal respiration were also measured to assess changes in both microbial biomass and activity throughout the soil profile. The 16S rDNA-DGGE revealed composite banding patterns reflecting the high bacterial diversity as expected for a forest soil, whereas 18S rDNA-DGGE analysis showed a certain stability and a lower diversity in the fungal communities. The banding patterns of the different horizons reflected changes in the microbial community structure with increasing depth. In particular, the DGGE analysis evidenced complex banding patterns for the upper A1 and A2 horizons, and a less diverse microflora in the deeper horizons. The low diversity and the presence of specific microbial communities in the B horizons, and in particular in the deeper ones, can be attributed to the selective environment represented by this portion of the soil profile. The eubacterial profiles obtained from the extracellular DNA revealed the presence of some bands not present in the total DNA patterns. This could be interpreted as the remainders of bacteria not any more present in the soil because of changes of edaphic conditions and consequent shifting in the microbial composition. These characteristic bands, present in all the horizons with the exception of the A1, should support the concept that the extracellular DNA is able to persist within the soil. Furthermore, the comparison between the total and extracellular 16S rDNA-DGGE profiles suggested a downwards movement of the extracellular DNA.},

@article{Olden2002,
abstract = {With the growth of statistical modeling in the ecological sciences,
researchers are using more complex methods, such as artificial neural
networks (ANNs), to address problems associated with pattern recognition
and prediction. Although in many studies ANNs have been shown to
exhibit superior predictive power compared to traditional approaches,
they have also been labeled a "black box" because they provide little
explanatory insight into the relative influence of the independent
variables in the prediction process. This lack of explanatory power
is a major concern to ecologists since the interpretation of statistical
models is desirable for gaining knowledge of the causal relationships
driving ecological phenomena. In this study, we describe a number
of methods for understanding the mechanics of ANNs (e.g. Neural Interpretation
Diagram, Garson's algorithm, sensitivity analysis). Next, we propose
and demonstrate a randomization approach for statistically assessing
the importance of axon connection weights and the contribution of
input variables in the neural network. This approach provides researchers
with the ability to eliminate null-connections between neurons whose
weights do not significantly influence the network output (i.e. predicted
response variable), thus facilitating the interpretation of individual
and interacting contributions of the input variables in the network.
Furthermore, the randomization approach can identify variables that
significantly contribute to network predictions, thereby providing
a variable selection method for ANNs. We show that by extending randomization
approaches to ANNs, the "black box" mechanics of ANNs can be greatly
illuminated. Thus, by coupling this new explanatory power of neural
networks with its strong predictive abilities, ANNs promise to be
a valuable quantitative tool to evaluate, understand, and predict
ecological phenomena.},

abstract = {IEEE The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission Level 4 Carbon (L4C) product provides model estimates of the Net Ecosystem CO {\&} {\#}x2082; exchange (NEE) incorporating SMAP soil moisture information. The L4C product includes NEE, computed as total ecosystem respiration less gross photosynthesis, at a daily time step posted to a 9-km global grid by plant functional type. Component carbon fluxes, surface soil organic carbon stocks, underlying environmental constraints, and detailed uncertainty metrics are also included. The L4C model is driven by the SMAP Level 4 Soil Moisture data assimilation product, with additional inputs from the Goddard Earth Observing System, Version 5 weather analysis, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite vegetation data. The L4C data record extends from March 31, 2015 to present with ongoing production and 8-12 day latency. Comparisons against concurrent global CO {\&} {\#}x2082; eddy flux tower measurements, satellite solar-induced canopy florescence, and other independent observation benchmarks show favorable L4C performance and accuracy, capturing the dynamic biosphere response to recent weather anomalies. Model experiments and L4C spatiotemporal variability were analyzed to understand the independent value of soil moisture and SMAP observations relative to other sources of input information. This analysis highlights the potential for microwave observations to inform models where soil moisture strongly controls land CO {\&} {\#}x2082; flux variability; however, skill improvement relative to flux towers is not yet discernable within the relatively short validation period. These results indicate that SMAP provides a unique and promising capability for monitoring the linked global terrestrial water and carbon cycles.},

abstract = {We evaluate the results of dynamically downscaled winter precipitation over Western Montana using the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model through comparison with estimates from the observationally based parameter-elevation regressions on independent slopes model (PRISM). Seven years (six winters) from 2000 to 2006 are simulated at 4 km resolution to assess the similarities and differences between the two models as well as the implications for hydrologic modeling. Inherent biases in both approaches are apparent, highlighting the difficulty in climate model validation. Results show general agreement between the two models in the spatial distribution of winter precipitation. A principal component analysis shows similar spatial patterns between models in the leading six components suggesting that the main processes that drive the spatial distribution of precipitation were properly captured. The first component explains almost 70{\%} of total variance, and the first three components explain more than 85{\%} in both data sets. The largest differences between the two data sets exist in areas at high elevation and upstream of the continental divide where observations are sparse. In these areas, WRF consistently predicts higher amounts of precipitation and larger interannual variability than PRISM. We suggest that these results are realistic for impingement of moist air masses on topography and, if correct, could have significant implications in flood forecasting, water resource management, and climate change studies. {\textcopyright} 2013.

abstract = {For the evaluation and monitoring of the water quality, a series of methodologies, which have as basis an ample variety of bioindicators, may be applied. The aim of this research was to evaluate the use of ecotoxicity assays with Daphnia magna and Danio rerio as alert systems in water contaminated with toxic substances. Using two toxicity databases, the sensibility of those aquatic organisms to a wide variety of chemical products and elements and to some chemical categories was investigated. The relation between the reference dose for human oral chronic exposure (RfD) of all chemical products and the acute toxicity values for both bioindicators was also studied. Acute toxicity tests with D. magna respond to a larger variety of chemicals with a higher sensitivity than those with D. rerio. Although mammals, crustaceans and fish have different routes of exposure, target organs and toxic mechanisms, acute toxicity essays with fish and Daphnia may be used as an initial screening before mammal models are used.},

abstract = {There is a direct influence of global warming on precipitation. Increased heating leads to greater evaporation and thus surface drying, thereby increasing the intensity and duration of drought. However, the water holding capacity of air increases by about 7{\%} per 1 C warming, which leads to increased water vapor in the atmosphere. Hence, storms, whether individual thunderstorms, extratropical rain or snow storms, or tropical cyclones, supplied with increased moisture, produce more intense precipitation events. Such events are observed to be widely occurring, even where total precipitation is decreasing: 'it never rains but it pours!' This increases the risk of flooding. The atmospheric and surface energy budget plays a critical role in the hydrological cycle, and also in the slower rate of change that occurs in total precipitation than total column water vapor. With modest changes in winds, patterns of precipitation do not change much, but result in dry areas becoming drier (generally throughout the subtropics) and wet areas becoming wetter, especially in the mid-to high latitudes: the 'rich get richer and the poor get poorer'. This pattern is simulated by climate models and is projected to continue into the future. Because, with warming, more precipitation occurs as rain instead of snow and snow melts earlier, there is increased runoff and risk of flooding in early spring, but increased risk of drought in summer, especially over continental areas. However, with more precipitation per unit of upward motion in the atmosphere, i.e. 'more bang for the buck', atmospheric circulation weakens, causing monsoons to falter. In the tropics and subtropics, precipitation patterns are dominated by shifts as sea surface temperatures change, with El Nino a good example. The volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 led to an unprecedented drop in land precipitation and runoff, and to widespread drought, as precipitation shifted from land to oceans and evaporation faltered, providing lessons for possible geoengineering. Most models simulate precipitation that occurs prematurely and too often, and with insufficient intensity, resulting in recycling that is too large and a lifetime of moisture in the atmosphere that is too short, which affects runoff and soil moisture.},

abstract = {Most activities that support economic growth in the S{\~{a}}o Francisco River Basin (Brazil) need water. Allocation of the water resources to each competing use needs quantification in order to develop an integrated water management plan. Irrigation agriculture is the largest water consuming activity in the basin. It has produced large economic and social advancements in the region and has potential for further development. The local development agency in the S{\~{a}}o Francisco River has projected an increase of more than 500,000 ha in irrigation developments distributed within the basin. Water requirements of the projected irrigation expansions and their effects on river flow were quantified. A semi-distributed model was constructed to simulate the water balance in 16 watersheds within the basin. The watersheds were hydrologically characterized by the average precipitation, atmospheric demand and runoff as well as their variability. Water requirements for increased irrigated agriculture were calculated using an agronomic mass balance. A Monte Carlo procedure generated the variability of irrigation requirements and resulting decreased river flows from the multidimensional probability distribution of the hydrologic variables of each watershed. Irrigation requirements were found to be more variable during the wet season because of weather variability. In contrast to what might be expected, in drier years, irrigation requirements were often larger during the wet season than in the dry season because the cropped area is largest in the wet months and variability of precipitation is greater. Increased irrigation shifted downward the distribution of river flows but not enough to affect other strategic water uses such as hydropower. Further irrigation expansion may be limited by wet season flows. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The problems caused by water scarcity demand important changes in the criteria and objectives of water policies. The agricultural sector in Spain consumes up to 80{\%} of all available hydric resources and the need to increase the effciency of current uses of water in the agricultural sector is at the core of the country's national water policy. One alternative would be to resort to water pricing policies with the aim of providing incentives to save water consumption although it would inict a certain degree of income losses to the farmers and raise the revenue collected by the water authorities. The objective of this research is to analyze the effect caused by the application of different water pricing policies on water demand, farmers' income and the revenue collected by the government agency. To undertake this analysis a dynamic mathematical programming model has been built that simulates farmers' behavior and their response to different water pricing scenarios. Empirical application of the model has been carried out in several irrigation districts in Spain covering varied farm regions and river basins. Results show that the effects of alternative pricing policies for irrigation water are strongly dependent on regional, structural and institutional conditions and that changing policies produce distinct consequences within the same region and water district. Thus, equivalent water charges would create widespread effects on water savings, farm income and collected government revenue across regions and districts},

Modifications to SEBAL inputs that reduced discrepancies with TSEB and observations for bare soil and shrub classes tended to increase differences for other land cover classes.

These results suggest that some of the simplifying assumptions in SEBAL may not be strictly applicable over the wide range in conditions present within these landscapes. An analysis of TSEB and SEBAL sensitivity to uncertainties in primary inputs indicated that errors in surface temperature or surface-air temperature differences had the greatest impact on H estimates.

abstract = {Satellite-based passive microwave remote sensing has been shown to be a valuable tool in mapping and monitoring global soil moisture. The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on the Aqua platform (AMSR-E) has made significant contributions to this application. As the result of agency and individual initiatives, several approaches for the retrieval of soil moisture from AMSR-E have been proposed and implemented. Although the majority of these are based on the same Radiative Transfer Equation, studies have shown that the resulting soil moisture estimates can differ significantly. A primary goal of this investigation is to understand these differences and develop a suitable approach to potentially improve the algorithm currently used by NASA in producing its operational soil moisture product. In order to achieve this goal, the theoretical basis of several alternative soil moisture retrieval algorithms are examined. Analysis has focused on five established approaches: the operational algorithm adopted by NASA, which is referred to as the Normalized Polarization Difference algorithm, the Single Channel Algorithm, the Land Parameter Retrieval Model, the University of Montana soil moisture algorithm, and the HydroAlgo Artificial Neural Network algorithm. Previous comparisons of these algorithms in the literature have typically focused on the retrieved soil moisture products, and employed different metrics and data sets, and have resulted in differing conclusions. In this investigation we attempt to provide a more thorough understanding of the fundamental differences between the algorithms and how these differences affect their performance in terms of range of soil moisture provided. The comparative overview presented in the paper is based on the operating versions of the source codes of the individual algorithms. Analysis has indicated that the differences between algorithms lie in the specific parameterizations and assumptions of each algorithm. The comparative overview of the theoretical basis of the approaches is linked to differences found in the soil moisture retrievals, leading to suggestions for improvements and increased reliability in these algorithms.},

abstract = {Global warming is expected to enhance fluxes of fresh water between the surface and atmosphere, causing wet regions to become wetter and dry regions drier, with serious implications for water resource management. Defining the wet and dry regions as the upper 30{\%} and lower 70{\%} of the precipitation totals across the tropics (30° S–30° N) each month we combine observations and climate model simulations to understand changes in the wet and dry regions over the period 1850–2100. Observed decreases in precipitation over dry tropical land (1950–2010) are also simulated by coupled atmosphere–ocean climate models (−0.3{\%}/decade) with trends projected to continue into the 21st century. Discrepancies between observations and simulations over wet land regions since 1950 exist, relating to decadal fluctuations in El Ni{\~{n}}o southern oscillation, the timing of which is not represented by the coupled simulations. When atmosphere-only simulations are instead driven by observed sea surface temperature they are able to adequately represent this variability over land. Global distributions of precipitation trends are dominated by spatial changes in atmospheric circulation. However, the tendency for already wet regions to become wetter (precipitation increases with warming by 3{\%} K −1 over wet tropical oceans) and the driest regions drier (precipitation decreases of −2{\%} K −1 over dry tropical land regions) emerges over the 21st century in response to the substantial surface warming.},

Using field data, principles of mass balance in a control volume, the HYDRUS-1D software package for simulating one-dimensional movement of water, heat, and multiple solutes in variably-saturated media, and a model-independent parameter optimizer, the processes of soil water and solute movement in root zone and deep vadose zone were investigated. The optimization of unsaturated soil hydraulic parameters and downward flux (natural drainage) from the control volume against observed vadose zone salinity levels and shallow groundwater levels yield difficult to obtain natural drainage rate as a function of water table height within the control volume. The results show that the unsaturated soil hydraulic properties and the downward flux from the soil profile are the critical parameters. A "natural drainage approach" to sustainable land management for drainage-impaired land is proposed. With this approach it is feasible to design a sustainable land use regimen for drainage-impaired lands in general and retired lands in particular. {\textcopyright} 2010 ASCE.},

low precipitation rates and a stable spiral for wet conditions. The
spiral equilibrium indicates that the hillslope system is lightly
damped, and transient oscillations of the state variables are expected
for high precipitation rates. The timescale of these oscillations is of
the order of-several days to weeks for the model hillslopes examined.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the model contains a Hopf bifurcation
from a Stable static equilibrium to a stable limit cycle. The amplitude,
phase, and frequency of the limit cycle are determined analytically
using second-order averaging. However, this behavior is shown to be
nonphysical for the particular homogeneous soils and hillslope geometry
investigated. Implications of lightly damped behavior in the hillslope
system include moisture oscillations in the field under wet conditions
and difficulty in numerical solution of Richards' equation.},

abstract = {Diel cycles in stream discharge during baseflow periods in a headwater stream in La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, a tropical wet forest site, appear to be associated with groundwater withdrawal by the forest for evapotranspiration (ET). Analysis of the cycles indicates a strong correlation of stage change with ET demand, similar to the variation found in riparian water table elevation by previous researchers. Links between daily forest ET demand cycles and stream discharge cycles have been reported in temperate humid and semi-arid regions, but the frequent flood hydrographs of the wet tropics tend to obscure this daily signal. This study modifies and combines two established empirical methods for analyzing the diel ET signal in streamflow which lead to estimates of riparian ET derived from groundwater (ETG) at hourly time scales and spatial extent of the riparian area. The model has a direct dependence on the estimate of specific yield, a difficult to constrain parameter, which we estimate from previously published soil analyses. For the six baseflow periods analyzed, the model estimates groundwater ET losses ranging from 1.8 to 3.9. mm/day within the riparian area. These estimates are 52-81{\%} of the total ET estimated with the Penman-Monteith equation (ETPM). The signal of ETGin the stream lags ETPMby 1.5-3. h, with apparent peak decay and signal duration lengthening during propagation. Model results indicate that the area of the riparian zone that influences streamflow by means of ET withdrawal increases with stream stage and ranges from 2.5{\%} to 6.6{\%} of the total basin area. Variations in the rate of change of nightly stream stage recovery suggest possible variations in the relative importance of subsurface hydraulic properties. At high stages, the rate of stream stage recovery from ET losses decreases throughout the night, whereas at low stages the rate of stream stage recovery increases throughout the night. Future work with numerical models could explore mechanistic controls on these empirically-derived recovery functions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Random roughness was calculated as the standard deviation of micro-relief

for different surface roughness inclined at different slopes. Micro-relief
height measurements were taken before and after individual rainfall
applications in order to monitor changes in random roughness with
cumulative rainfall.Regressing random roughness against rainfall
showed that random roughness decreases exponentially with increase
in water application. A regression equation which relates depression
storage to slope steepness and random roughness was developed. Another
regression equation was developed to predict Manning's resistance
coefficient from random roughness. This approach of relating Manning's
resistance coefficient to dynamic surface parameters can be applied
to whole seasons as well as individual rainfall events. These relationships
can potentially be incorporated into simulation models of soil water

The model results show that improving the representation of surface topography through higher spatial resolution or a subgrid method has a large impact on the simulations. Both the subgrid scheme and the regional model significantly improved the simulation of snowpack in the mountains. The spatial distributions of precipitation and snowpack are generally consistent between the subgrid and regional simulations, since they were driven by the same large-scale circulation from the global simulations. However, because rain-shadow effects are not represented in the subgrid scheme, the regional simulations produced much more realistic spatial variability in precipitation and snowpack than the subgrid simulations in narrow mountain ranges. In the climate change experiments, both downscaling procedures preserved the large-scale patterns of temperature and precipitation changes in the global simulations. However, the regional simulations show larger changes in precipitation and snowpack along the coastal mountains than the subgrid simulations.

areas (2) and for heavy rainfalls. It is assumed that: (1) the rainfall
excess nearly equals the effective rainfall; and (2) the rainfall
intensity function depends on time alone and is single-peaked. The
catchment area is approximated by two rectangular planes of not necessarily
equal width but with constant bottom slopes and constant roughness
factors. A small stream runs where the two planes intersect each
other. Both the overland and the stream flow are assumed to be fully
turbulent; they are modelled using the Manning-Strickler formula.
Kinematic wave theory serves as the mathematical model to compute
the hydrographs at an arbitrary location in terms of the prescribed,
basic parameters. The solutions are displayed graphically, which
allows direct determination of the solution sought.Variations in
the average bottom slope and the average friction coefficient are
found to have little influence on the resulting hydrograph. Rough
estimates of these parameters suffice to obtain fair results. The
model is tested by comparing observations collected in western Switzerland
with present predictions. Agreement between the computed and the
observed hydrographs is fair, given the simplicity of the described
hydrological model. A step-by-step procedure with examples illustrate

Because seasonal variations in CO(2) flux in temperate forests are closely correlated with plant phenology, we quantified the phenology of forest species in a multilayered forest with patches of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and oak (Quercus robur L.) in Brasschaat, Belgium. A scaling-up modeling approach was developed to simulate reflectance at the leaf and canopy scales over a one-year cycle. Chlorophyll concentration, water content, specific leaf area and leaf area index of the forest species were measured throughout an entire year (1997). Scaling-up from the leaf to canopy was achieved by linking the PROSPECT and SAIL models. The result is the annual progression of the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) in a 1 km(2) forest area, which can be directly related to high-resolution, remotely sensed data.},

The study was aimed at understanding the relationships between runoff production, vegetation patterns and microtopography at different spatial scales within a sparsely vegetated, semiarid area. The results of runoff monitoring and rainfall simulation experiments showed that runoff did not occur at the slope scale. It was buffered at the terracette level by nonuniform infiltration at the rims of terracettes and at the hummock scale by rapid infiltration under oak shrubs and trees. Slope and catchment runoff were not connected to runoff at these fine scales. The field evidence is discussed within the context of hierarchy theory, and the implications for management of these shrublands are related to maintaining both the vegetation mosaic and runoff on these slopes.

This work has typically been limited to consider one-dimensional exchange and cycling within patches and has not incorporated the effects of lateral redistribution of soil moisture, coupled ecosystem carbon and nitrogen cycling, and vegetation allocation processes along topographic gradients. We extend this theory to the hillslope and catchment scale, with in situ and downslope feedbacks between water, carbon and nutrient cycling within a fully transient, distributed model. We explore whether ecosystem patches linked along hydrologic flow paths as a catena evolve to form an emergent pattern optimized to local climate and topographic conditions. Lateral hydrologic connectivity of a small catchment is calibrated with streamflow data and further tested with measured soil moisture patterns. Then, the spatial gradient of vegetation density within a small catchment estimated with fine-resolution satellite imagery and field measurements is evaluated with simulated vegetation growth patterns from different root depth and allocation strategies as a function of hillslope position. This is also supported by the correspondence of modeled and field measured spatial patterns of root depths and catchment-level aboveground vegetation productivity. We test whether the simulated spatial pattern of vegetation corresponds to measured canopy patterns and an optimal state relative to a set of ecosystem processes, defined as maximizing ecosystem productivity and water use efficiency at the catchment scale. Optimal carbon uptake ranges show effective compromises between multiple resources (water, light, and nutrients), modulated by vegetation allocation dynamics along hillslope gradient.},

abstract = {Bio-economic farm models are tools to evaluate ex-post or to assess ex-ante the impact of policy and technology change on agriculture, economics and environment. Recently, various BEFMs have been developed, often for one purpose or location, but hardly any of these models are re-used later for other purposes or locations. The Farm System Simulator (FSSIM) provides a generic framework enabling the application of BEFMs under various situations and for different purposes (generating supply response functions and detailed regional or farm type assessments). FSSIM is set up as a component-based framework with components representing farmer objectives, risk, calibration, policies, current activities, alternative activities and different types of activities (e.g., annual and perennial cropping and livestock). The generic nature of FSSIM is evaluated using five criteria by examining its applications. FSSIM has been applied for different climate zones and soil types (criterion 1) and to a range of different farm types (criterion 2) with different specializations, intensities and sizes. In most applications FSSIM has been used to assess the effects of policy changes and in two applications to assess the impact of technological innovations (criterion 3). In the various applications, different data sources, level of detail (e.g., criterion 4) and model configurations have been used. FSSIM has been linked to an economic and several biophysical models (criterion 5). The model is available for applications to other conditions and research issues, and it is open to be further tested and to be extended with new components, indicators or linkages to other models.},

abstract = {This paper attempts to assess the impact of improved estimates of
areal potential evapotranspiration (PE) on the results of two rainfall-runoff
models. A network of 42 PE stations was used for a sample of 62 watersheds
and two watershed models of different complexity (the four-parameter
GR4J model and an eight-parameter modified version of TOPMODEL),
to test how sensitive rainfall-runoff models were to watershed PE
estimated with the Penman equation.First, Penman PE estimates were
regionalized in the Massif Central highlands of France, a mountainous
area where PE is known to vary greatly with elevation, latitude,
and longitude. The two watershed models were then used to assess
changes in model efficiency with the improved PE input. Finally,
the behavior of one of the model's parameters was analyzed, to understand
how watershed models cope with systematic errors in the estimated
PE input.In terms of model efficiency, in both models it was found
that very simple assumptions on watershed PE input (the same average
input for all watersheds) yield the same results as more accurate
input obtained from regionalization. The detailed evaluation of the
GR4J model calibrated with different PE input scenarios showed that
the model is clearly sensitive to PE input, but that it uses its
two production parameters to adapt to the various PE scenarios.},

abstract = {Despite recognition of the potential economic benefits and increasing interest in developing marketing instruments, water markets have remained thin and slow to evolve due to high transactions costs, third party effects, and the persistence of historical institutions for water allocation. Water banks are a marketing instrument that can address these obstacles to trade, allowing irrigators within a region to exchange water in order to mitigate the short-term effects of drought. Water banks coexist with the institu- tions governing water allocation, which implies that rule changes, such as adoption of a system of conjunc- tive surface water-groundwater administration, carry implications for the economic impacts of banking. This paper assesses and compares the welfare and distributional outcomes for irrigators in the Eastern Snake River Plain of Idaho under a suite of water management and drought scenarios. We find that water banking can offset irrigators' profit losses during drought, but that its ability to do so depends on whether it facili- tates trade across groundwater and surface water users. With conjunctive administration, a bank allowing trade by source realizes 22.23{\%} of the maximum potential efficiency gains from trade during a severe drought, while a bank that allows trade across sources realizes 93.47{\%} of the maximum potential gains. Dur- ing drought, conjunctive administration redistributes welfare from groundwater to surface water producers, but banking across sources allows groundwater irrigators to recover 88.4{\%} of the profits lost from drought at a cost of 2.2{\%} of the profit earned by surface water irrigators},

abstract = {Ground-based measurement of the spatial distribution of soil moisture
can be difficult because sampling is essentially made at a point
and the choice of both sample depth and sample spacing affects the
interpretation of the measurements.Hydrological interest has generally
been in soil moisture of the root zone. Microwave Remote Sensing
methods are now available that allow the interpretation of spatial
distributions of soil moisture, however, their signals respond to
moisture in the upper few centimetres of soil. These instruments
are still being developed, but one of the questions surrounding their
application is how to interpret the surface moisture in a hydrological
context. In this study we compare measurements of soil moisture in
0-30 cm of soil with those in 0-6 cm to examine how representative
this surface measure is with regard to the root zone.Detailed spatial
measurements of soil moisture were conducted at three pasture sites
in the 50 km2 Mahurangi River catchment of northern New Zealand
as part of a comprehensive hydrology project; MARVEX (MAhurangi River
Variability EXperiment). In three field sites, on each of three occasions,
field measurements were made using both 30 and 6 cm dielectric-based
instruments. Spatial grids of several hundred moisture measurements
were collected over 0-30 cm and compared with those collected
simultaneously over 0-6 cm.Results indicate that temporal and
spatial issues interfere with correlation of the two sets of series.
Rapid wetting of 0-6 cm compared with 0-30 cm is seen following
storm activity. Some evidence of the decoupling of moisture content
response is also evident when sites are measured on days following
a storm. Rapid, but not unrealistic, response to intense rainfall
was also observed.Implications are that detailed and accurate knowledge
of local soil conditions and a sound model of soil water redistribution
are required before surface soil moisture measurements can be used
to infer root zone behaviour. Such knowledge was not available in
this study, from either published data or field observation. In this
study, without suitable a priori knowledge, soil property information
was found via calibration.},

abstract = {Soil surface characteristics are closely related to soil surface depressional
storage, infiltration, runoff generation and soil erosion, especially
in highly erodible loess soil. Soil surface random roughness, soil
cohesion and aggregate stability are necessary parameters in the
Limburg Soil Erosion Model (LISEM) and helpful in developing alternative
land-use and conservation strategies. Over a period of 2 years, soil
surface characteristics were measured continuously in Danangou, a
small catchment in the hilly, gullied loess area in China, with the
support of the Erochina project. The results show that soil surface
random roughness, soil cohesion and aggregate stability differed
significantly between land-use types. Ranking the types on soil roughness
during the monitoring period yielded the sequence cropland{\textgreater}orchard
and wasteland and fallow land{\textgreater}shrubland{\textgreater}woodland. The corresponding
sequence for aggregate stability was approximately wasteland and
woodland{\textgreater}cropland and orchard{\textgreater}shrubland{\textgreater}fallow land. Cohesion in
the different land-use types in the catchment was smallest for cropland
and largest for wasteland. There were no significant differences
between croplands with different topographical characteristics. All
of these soil surface characteristics showed significant temporal
variation over the monitoring period. Temporal variations in roughness
for shrubland and woodland over the 2-year period were significantly
greater than those for other land-use types. There were also considerable
variations in cohesion for shrubland, woodland and wasteland. In
1998, the weighted average values of roughness, aggregate stability
and cohesion for the entire catchment were 1.113 cm, 13.6 drops and
0.131 kg/cm2, respectively, with C.V. values of 9.6{\%}, 32.05{\%} and
21.11{\%}. The corresponding values for 1999 were 1.616 cm, 11.52 drops

temporal and spatial variations in soil surface characteristics in
the catchment should be carefully taken into account in LISEM calibration

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Author(s) 2014. Natural grasses in semiarid rangelands constitute an effective protection against soil erosion and degradation, are a source of natural food for livestock and play a critical role in the hydrologic cycle by contributing to the uptake and transpiration of water. However, natural pastures are threatened by land abandonment and the consequent encroachment of shrubs and trees as well as by changing climatic conditions. In spite of their ecological and economic importance, the spatiotemporal variations of pasture production at the decadal-century scales over whole watersheds are poorly known. We used a physically based, spatially distributed ecohydrologic model applied to a 99.5 ha semiarid watershed in western Spain to investigate the sensitivity of pasture production to climate variability. The ecohydrologic model was run using a 300-year-long synthetic daily climate data set generated using a stochastic weather generator. The data set reproduced the range of climatic variations observed under the current climate. Results indicated that variation of pasture production largely depended on factors that also determined the availability of soil moisture such as the temporal distribution of precipitation, topography, and tree canopy cover. The latter is negatively related with production, reflecting the importance of rainfall and light interception, as well as water consumption by trees. Valley bottoms and flat areas in the lower parts of the catchment are characterized by higher pasture production but more interannual variability. A quantitative assessment of the quality of the simulations showed that ecohydrologic models are a valuable tool to investigate long-term (century scale) water and energy fluxes, as well as vegetation dynamics, in semiarid rangelands.},

abstract = {Transport processes and pathways through many hydrodynamic systems vary over time, often driven by variations in total water storage. This paper develops a very general approach to modeling unsteady transport through an arbitrary control volume (such as a watershed) that accounts for temporal variability in the underlying transport dynamics. Controls on the selection of discharge from stored waterare encapsulated in probability distributions XQðST; tÞ of age-ranked storage ST(the volume of water in storage ranked from youngest to oldest). This framework is applied to a long-term record of rainfall and stream-ﬂow chloride in a small, humid watershed at Plynlimon, UK. While a time-invariant gamma distribution forX Qproduced a good ﬁt to data, the ﬁt was signiﬁcantly improved when the distribution was allowed to vary with catchment storage. However, the variation was inverse to that of a ‘‘well-mixed'' system where storage has a pure dilution effect. Discharge at high storage was predicted to contain a larger fraction of recent event water than at low storage. The effective volume of storage involved in transport was 3411 mmat mean catchment wetness, but declined by 71 mm per 1 mm of additional catchment storage, while thefraction of event water in discharge increased by 1.4{\%}. This ‘‘inverse storage effect'' is sufﬁcient to repro-duce the observed long-memory 1=f fractal spectral structure of stream chloride. Metrics quantifying thestrength and direction of storage effects are proposed as useful signatures, and point toward a uniﬁedframework for observing and modeling coupled watershed ﬂow and transport.},

abstract = {The soil water content is recognized as one of many runoff controlling
factors in semiarid environments. A simple, physically based distributed
model has been developed to study the role of antecedent soil water
content in runoff generation in three small catchments in semiarid
southeast Spain. The catchments were set up in two different zones:
a burnt area with scarce vegetation and unburnt area with a denser
plant cover. The infiltration process is determined by the Green-Ampt
equation and the initial soil water content is taken into account
by means of maps obtained by Conditional Gaussian simulation. The
model was run 2700 times with different soil moisture scenarios and
design storms. Stochastic sensitivity analysis was used to examine
the role of antecedent soil water content in the runoff response.
The results showed that the hydrological response after high intensity,
low frequency storms is independent of the initial soil water content.
On the other hand, the antecedent soil water content is an important
factor controlling runoff during medium and low intensity storms,
a type of rainstorm that is relatively frequent in semiarid areas.
The sensitivity of the runoff response to soil moisture depended
on the predominant runoff mechanisms. When infiltration excess overland
flow is predominant, as a result of high rain intensities or less
permeable soils, the runoff response is more uniform and does not
depend on initial soil moisture. Runoff from less intense storms
on soils of higher permeability is controlled by the soil water content
of the surface soil layers and is more dependent on initial conditions.
The role of the initial soil water content is more important in catchments
where the presence of plant cover produces a patchwork of runoff
and runon sites, whose spatial pattern is highly dependent on the
soil water status.},

@article{Sperry2003,
abstract = {Soil and xylem are similar hydraulically. An unsaturated conductivity curve for soil is called a vulnerability curve for xylem--but the underlying physical basis is the same. Thus, any transport model that treats unsaturated soil conductivity would benefit by also incorporating the analogous xylem vulnerability curves. This is especially the case for crop plants, which as a group have relatively vulnerable xylem. Although the cohesion-tension mechanism for xylem transport has withstood recent challenges, a number of gaps remain in our understanding of xylem hydraulics. These include the extent and mechanism of cavitation reversal and thus hysteresis in the vulnerability curve, the structural basis for differences in air entry pressure (=cavitation pressure) for different xylem types, a quantitative model of xylem conductivity, and a mechanistic understanding of how stomata regulate plant water status. Improving the representation of xylem hydraulics in models of crop water use is necessary to achieve a mechanistic link between soil water availability and canopy water use. An important additional knowledge gap concerns the hydraulics of the living tissues of absorbing roots and transpiring leaves, which are more complex than in xylem and less amenable to mechanistic modeling at present.},

This study investigates oceanic and atmospheric controls underlying changes in timing, variability, and trends documented across the entire hydroclimatic-monitoring system within critical NRM watersheds.

Over the past four decades, midelevation SNOTEL records show a tendency toward decreased snowpack with peak snow water equivalent (SWE) arriving and melting out earlier. Temperature records show significant seasonal and annual decreases in the number of frost days (days {\textless}= 0 degrees C) and changes in spring minimum temperatures that correspond with atmospheric circulation changes and surface albedo feedbacks in March and April. Warmer spring temperatures coupled with increases in mean and variance of spring precipitation correspond strongly to earlier snowmeltout, an increased number of snow-free days, and observed changes in streamflow timing and discharge. The majority of the variability in peak and total annual snowpack and streamflow, however, is explained by season-dependent interannual-to-interdecadal changes in atmospheric circulation associated with Pacific Ocean sea surface temperatures. Over recent decades, increased spring precipitation appears to be buffering NRM total annual streamflow from what would otherwise be greater snow-related declines in hydrologic yield.

abstract = {In many mountain regions, large land areas with heterogeneous soils have become ice-free with the ongoing glacier retreat. On these recently formed proglacial fields, the melt of the remaining glaciers typically drives pronounced diurnal stream level fluctuations that propagate into the riparian zone. This behaviour was measured on the Damma glacier forefield in central Switzerland with stage recorders in the stream and groundwater monitoring wells along four transects. In spite of the large groundwater stage variations, radon measurements in the near-stream riparian zone indicate that there is little mixing between stream water and groundwater on daily time scales. At all four transects, including both losing and gaining reaches, the groundwater level fluctuations lagged the stream stage variations and were often damped with distance from the stream. Similar behaviours have been modelled using the diffusion equation in coastal regions influenced by tidal sea level variations. We thus tested the ability of such a model to predict groundwater level fluctuations in proglacial fields. The model reproduced several key features of the observed fluctuations at three of four locations, although discrepancies also arise due to non representative input data and model simplifications. Nevertheless, calibration of the model for the individual transects yielded realistic estimates of hydraulic diffusivities between the stream and groundwater monitoring wells. We conclude that studying diurnal groundwater fluctuations can provide important information about the subsurface hydrology of alpine watersheds dominated by glacier melt.},

abstract = {AbstractDrought indices are often used for monitoring interannual variability in macroscale hydrology. However, the diversity of drought indices raises several issues: 1) which indices perform best and where; 2) does the incorporation of potential evapotranspiration (PET) in indices strengthen relationships, and how sensitive is the choice of PET methods to such results; 3) what additional value is added by using higher-spatial-resolution gridded climate layers; and 4) how have observed relationships changed through time. Standardized precipitation index, standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), Palmer drought severity index, and water balance runoff (WBR) model output were correlated to water-year runoff for 21 unregulated drainage basins in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. SPEI and WBR with time scales encompassing the primary precipitation season maximized the explained variance in water-year runoff in most basins.

Factors which influence soil water content variability in semiarid
areas are differente from those in humid zones. Factors like depth
to water table do not influence soil water variablility in semiarid
areas as they do in humid areas whereas hillslope aspects are more
influential in semiarid zones than in humid ones.$\backslash$par $\backslash$ql$\backslash$li0$\backslash$fi0$\backslash$ri0$\backslash$sb0$\backslash$sl$\backslash$sa0

Grayson et al (1997)$\backslash$plain$\backslash$f0$\backslash$fs20$\backslash$cf0 determined two main states
in spatial soil moisture patterns: when precipitation continuously
exceeds evapotranspiration the topography upslope of a given point
is the dominant control. When evapotranspiration continuously exceeds
precipitation, moisture patterns reflect soil and vegetation differences
and topographic influence is extended to highly convoluted zones
following rain. This second state is predominant in semiarid areas.$\backslash$par
$\backslash$ql$\backslash$li0$\backslash$fi0$\backslash$ri0$\backslash$sb0$\backslash$sl$\backslash$sa0 $\backslash$plain$\backslash$f0$\backslash$fs20$\backslash$cf0 $\backslash$par $\backslash$ql$\backslash$li0$\backslash$fi0$\backslash$ri0$\backslash$sb0$\backslash$sl$\backslash$sa0
$\backslash$plain$\backslash$f0$\backslash$fs20$\backslash$cf0 Wetness indices suppose that subsurface lateral
flow dominates soil moisture distribution, and that there is a connection
between a point in the catchment and its upslope area (see $\backslash$plain$\backslash$f0$\backslash$fs20$\backslash$cf0$\backslash$b
Beven and Kirkby, 1979, O'Loughlin, 1986; Barling et al., 1994$\backslash$plain$\backslash$f0$\backslash$fs20$\backslash$cf0
). In dry environments, subsurface water redistribution is restricted
to a few short periods of the year, and most of the time, moisture
redistribution is dominated by vertical fluxes with no connection
between points and the upslope area. In that case, soil water distribution
is controlled by other factor such as vegetation, hillslope aspect
or local topography.$\backslash$par $\backslash$ql$\backslash$li0$\backslash$fi0$\backslash$ri0$\backslash$sb0$\backslash$sl$\backslash$sa0 $\backslash$plain$\backslash$f0$\backslash$fs20$\backslash$cf0

performed at every soil moisture sample location are soil texture,
soil depth, slope, aspect, profile curvature heading slope direction
and contributing area at each point.$\backslash$par $\backslash$ql$\backslash$li0$\backslash$fi0$\backslash$ri0$\backslash$sb0$\backslash$sl$\backslash$sa0

For some authors ($\backslash$plain$\backslash$f0$\backslash$fs20$\backslash$cf0$\backslash$b Reynolds, 1997a,b; Henninger
et al., 1976; Vachaud et al., 1985; Crave and Gascuel-Odoux, 1997$\backslash$plain$\backslash$f0$\backslash$fs20$\backslash$cf0
), soil texture is the most influential factor in soil moisture patterns.
In a burnt soil Sand and Silt do not show different relations to
soil moisture depending on the moisture state of the basin (wet,
middle or dry) but Clay does depend on the general soil moisture
state, being more diffuse when general moisture conditions are dry.
Slope is another factor which maintains its relation with the general
moisture state of the basin.$\backslash$par $\backslash$ql$\backslash$li0$\backslash$fi0$\backslash$ri0$\backslash$sb0$\backslash$sl$\backslash$sa0 $\backslash$plain$\backslash$f0$\backslash$fs20$\backslash$cf0
In a vegetated basin, the contributing area is one of the most influential
factors determining soil moisture spatial pattern in wet, middel
and dry conditions, though its determination decreases as the basin
becomes dryer. Aspect is also one of the most determinant factors
in soil moisture distribution in wet and middle conditions but is
not significant in dry conditions. The same occurrs with soil depth.
Curvature is only significant in wet conditions.$\backslash$par $\backslash$ql$\backslash$li0$\backslash$fi0$\backslash$ri0$\backslash$sb0$\backslash$sl$\backslash$sa0
$\backslash$plain$\backslash$f0$\backslash$fs20$\backslash$cf0 The difference between the influential factors
in the burnt and unburnt zone is due to the physiological activity
of vegetation (see $\backslash$plain$\backslash$f0$\backslash$fs20$\backslash$cf0$\backslash$b Francis et al., 1986; G$\backslash$'f3mez-Plaza
et al., 2000$\backslash$plain$\backslash$f0$\backslash$fs20$\backslash$cf0 ). Vegetation alters the local control
factors affecting soil water content.$\backslash$par $\backslash$ql$\backslash$li0$\backslash$fi0$\backslash$ri0$\backslash$sb0$\backslash$sl$\backslash$sa0

Nevertheless, and in spite of what has been said above, no factor
by itself rightly explained the spatial patterns of soil moisture
since it is influenced by several factors interacting toghether.$\backslash$par

$\backslash$plain$\backslash$f0$\backslash$fs20$\backslash$cf0 To assess that, multiple regression analysis has
been performed including each one stepwise to disscard those which
do not bring up any new extra information. In non vegetated areas,
texture was the most influential factor whereas in vegetated areas
aspect, curvature and contributing area gave the best explanation
but still a weak one being vegetation the most determining factor.$\backslash$par

$\backslash$plain$\backslash$f0$\backslash$fs20$\backslash$cf0 The predictive power of the wetness indices has
been assessed in humid catchments where runoff generation mechanism
is, generally, soil excess saturation. $\backslash$par $\backslash$ql$\backslash$li0$\backslash$fi0$\backslash$ri0$\backslash$sb0$\backslash$sl$\backslash$sa0
$\backslash$plain$\backslash$f0$\backslash$fs20$\backslash$cf0 However, in semiarid catchments soil water content
is strongly influenced by evapotranspiration which is affected by
radiation and vegetation canopy.$\backslash$par $\backslash$ql$\backslash$li0$\backslash$fi0$\backslash$ri0$\backslash$sb0$\backslash$sl$\backslash$sa0 $\backslash$plain$\backslash$f0$\backslash$fs20$\backslash$cf0

Index TI = ln(a/tg(b)) can be improved by adding the efect of solar
radiation implicit in the aspect value: new TI = ln(ASP*a/SLOPE).
It has also been checked that removing the efect of slope, which
gives no extra information but furthermore decreases the index eficiency
in semiarid environments, improves the prediction in vegetated catchments
in dry conditions.$\backslash$par $\backslash$ql$\backslash$li0$\backslash$fi0$\backslash$ri0$\backslash$sb0$\backslash$sl$\backslash$sa0 $\backslash$plain$\backslash$f0$\backslash$fs20$\backslash$cf0

abstract = {The influence of climate variation on the availability of water resources was analyzed in the headwaters of the Tagus River basin using two drought indices, the standardized precipitation index (SPI) and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). This basin is highly regulated and strategic, and contains two hyperannual reservoirs that are the origin of the water supply system for Mediterranean areas of southeast Spain. The indices confirmed that drought conditions have prevailed in the headwaters of the Tagus River since the 1970s. The responses in river discharge and reservoir storage were slightly higher when based on the SPEI rather than the SPI, which indicates that although precipitation had a major role in explaining temporal variability in the analyzed parameters, the influence of temperature was not negligible. Moreover, the greatest response in hydrological variables was evident over longer timescales of the climatic drought indices. Although the effect of climate variability on water resources was substantial during the analyzed period, we also showed a major change in hydrological-climatic relationships in regulated systems including reservoir storage and outflow. These were closely related to changes in external demand following commencement of the water transfer system to the J{\'{u}}car and Segura basins after the 1980s. The marked reduction in water availability in the basin, which is related to more frequent droughts, contrasts with the amount of water transferred, which shows a clear upward trend associated with increasing water demand in the Mediterranean basin. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

@article{McDowell2000,
abstract = {Soil surface CO(2) flux (F(s)) is the dominant respiratory flux in many temperate forest ecosystems. Snowpacks increase this dominance by insulating the soil against the low temperature to which aboveground components are exposed. However, measurement of F(s) in winter may be impeded by snow cover. Likewise, developing annual F(s) models is complicated by seasonal variation in root and microbial metabolism. We compared three methods of measuring sub-snow F(s): (1) dynamic chamber measurements at the upper snowpack surface (F(snow)), (2) dynamic chamber measurements at the soil surface via snowpits (F(soil)), and (3) static estimates based on measured concentrations of carbon dioxide ([CO(2)]) and conductance properties of the snowpack (F(diffusional)). Methods were compared at a mid-elevation forest in northeastern Washington, a mid-elevation forest in northern Idaho, and a high-elevation forest and neighboring meadow in Wyoming. The methods that minimized snowpack disturbance, F(diffusional) and F(snow), yielded similar estimates of F(s). In contrast, F(soil) yielded rates two to three times higher than F(snow) at the forested sites, and seven times higher at the subalpine meadow. The ratio F(soil)/F(snow) increased with increasing snow depth when compared across all sites. Snow removal appears to induce elevated soil flux as a result of lateral CO(2) diffusion into the pit. We chose F(snow) as our preferred method and used it to estimate annual CO(2) fluxes. The snowpack was present for 36{\%} of the year at this site, during which time 132 g C m(-2), or 17{\%} of the annual flux, occurred. We conclude that snowpack CO(2) flux is quantitatively important in annual carbon budgets for these forests and that the static and dynamic methods yield similar and reasonable estimates of the flux, as long as snowpack disturbance is minimized.},

Farmers′adjustments to changes in precipitation, surface water availability, and other factors are quantified using an economic model based on non-linear programming techniques. The models are externally linked. Results show that regional impacts, at the sub-basin level, vary depending on the location of each sub-basin relative to river flows. The effects of water use regulations and of exogenous price shocks on agriculture depend on weather, location, product mix and production technology. Implications of these results for policies designed to manage agriculture and water use are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2011 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {In small semiarid basins with ephemeral flows most of the sediment conveyance takes place during runoff peaks exceeding a certain discharge. Sediment load is commonly modelled using rating curves fitting the water-sediment discharge relationship. The performance of a feed-forward back-propagation artificial neural network (ANN) and a multiple quadratic regression (MQR) model are tested using data from the Parapu{\~{n}}os Catchment, a wooded rangeland located in SW Spain. Both models were calibrated using rainfall and discharge time series and derived variables such as rainfall intensity, runoff coefficient and rate of change of discharge. The final set of variables used in the analysis was done based on sensitivity analysis for the ANN model and based on an analysis of statistical significance of parameters in the MQR model. The performance of ANN and MQR were similar but better than rating curves of a single variable. In addition, ANN and MQR can reproduce the hysteretic loop of the sediment-discharge relationship.},

@article{Glenn2011,
abstract = {Crop coefficients were developed to determine crop water needs based on the evapotranspiration (ET) of a reference crop under a given set of meteorological conditions. Starting in the 1980s, crop coefficients developed through lysimeter studies or set by expert opinion began to be supplemented by remotely sensed vegetation indices (VI) that measured the actual status of the crop on a field-by-field basis. VIs measure the density of green foliage based on the reflectance of visible and near infrared (NIR) light from the canopy, and are highly correlated with plant physiological processes that depend on light absorption by a canopy such as ET and photosynthesis. Reflectance-based crop coefficients have now been developed for numerous individual crops, including corn, wheat, alfalfa, cotton, potato, sugar beet, vegetables, grapes and orchard crops. Other research has shown that VIs can be used to predict ET over fields of mixed crops, allowing them to be used to monitor ET over entire irrigation districts. VI-based crop coefficients can help reduce agricultural water use by matching irrigation rates to the actual water needs of a crop as it grows instead of to a modeled crop growing under optimal conditions. Recently, the concept has been applied to natural ecosystems at the local, regional and continental scales of measurement, using time-series satellite data from the MODIS sensors on the Terra satellite. VIs or other visible-NIR band algorithms are combined with meteorological data to predict ET in numerous biome types, from deserts, to arctic tundra, to tropical rainforests. These methods often closely match ET measured on the ground at the global FluxNet array of eddy covariance moisture and carbon flux towers. The primary advantage of VI methods for estimating ET is that transpiration is closely related to radiation absorbed by the plant canopy, which is closely related to VIs. The primary disadvantage is that they cannot capture stress effects or soil evaporation. Copyright 2011 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {The flow of meltwater through a snowpack can be described by Darcy's law, and by a set of equations relating conductivity, capillary pressure, and liquid water content which are similar to the equations governing unsaturated groundwater flow. Field observations were conducted which were designed to test the applicability of the unsaturated flow equations to the description of meltwater movement at the scale of a small watershed. Simple instrumentation was used to measure capillary pressure and meltwater flux rates; this was supplemented with energy and water balance measurements for the study watershed. Observations of surface snowmelt, meltwater flux, and streamflow for the snowmelt period confirm the nature of meltwater flow as described by the unsaturated flow equations, and illustrate the controlling influence of snowpack hydraulics on the streamflow hydrograph. Observed speeds of the meltwater wave front in the snowpack average about 0.22 m h{\^{a}}ˆ'1 and capillary pressures and kinematic wave speeds observed are comparable to those reported in other deep-snow environments. The difficulty of obtaining reliable liquid water content measurements is identified as a major limitation in the determination of hydraulic properties of the snowpack.},

abstract = {The degree of spatial variability of soil moisture and the ability
of environmental attributes to predict that variability were studied
at the Da Nangou catchment (3.5 km2) in the semi-arid loess area
of China. Soil moisture measurements were performed biweekly at five
depths in the soil profile (0-5 cm, 10-15 cm, 20-25 cm, 40-45 cm
and 70-75 cm) from May to October 1998 and from May to September
1999 using Delta-T theta probe. Results indicated that with increasing
soil depth, the mean soil moisture content increases significantly
for five layers and the coefficients of variation (CV) also increases
with depth from 10-15 cm. It was observed that heavier rains and
higher mean moisture contents are often associated with lower spatial
variability (CV). Environmental attributes such as land use and topography
play controlling roles in the spatial distribution of soil moisture
content. However, the relative roles of these environmental indices
vary with soil depth. The dominant controls on spatial variability
of the time-averaged soil moisture changes from land use, aspect,
relative elevation and hillslope position in the surface soil (0-5
cm) to relative elevation, hillslope position and aspect in the subsurface
soil (10-15 cm, 20-25 cm), and to land use, relative elevation and
slope gradient at larger depths (40-45 cm, 70-75 cm). The dynamic
behavior of influences of different environmental indices on the
layer-averaged soil moisture depends on several factors. In general,
the correlation of soil moisture with slope gradient shows a more
significant increase following a greater amount of antecedent precipitation
(except for the extremely heavy storms), and declines afterwards.
The relation of soil moisture with relative elevation and hillslope
position exhibits an opposite trend. It was observed that the influence
of land use corresponds to the difference in vegetative characteristics,
with a stronger influence in June and August with a greater difference
in vegetation. A significant influence of cos(aspect) was found during
early spring and autumn with a rapid transient in solar irradiation.
Finally, it was found that the sample size is adequate to estimate
the catchment mean soil moisture at all five depths and on all 10
observations in 1999 (81 sites), while it is only enough for the
upper soil layers (0-5 cm and 10-15 cm) in 1998 (26 sites).},

abstract = {The NCEP and NCAR are cooperating in a project (denoted ''reanalysis'') to produce a 40-year record of global analyses of atmospheric fields in support of the needs of the research and climate monitoring communities. This effort involves the recovery of land surface, ship, rawinsonde, pibal, aircraft, satellite, and other data; quality controlling and assimilating these data with a data assimilation system that is kept unchanged over the reanalysis period 1957-96. This eliminates perceived climate jumps associated with changes in the data assimilation system. The NCEP/NCAR 40-yr reanalysis uses a frozen state-of-the-art global data assimilation system and a database as complete as possible. The data assimilation and the model used are identical to the global system implemented operationally at the NCEP on 11 January 1995, except that the horizontal resolution is T62 (about 210 km). The database has been enhanced with many sources of observations not available in real time for operations, provided by different countries and organizations. The system has been designed with advanced quality control and monitoring components, and can produce 1 mon of reanalysis per day on a Gray YMP/8 supercomputer. Different types of output archives are being created to satisfy different user needs, including a ''quick look'' CD-ROM (one per year) with six tropospheric and stratospheric fields available twice daily, as well as surface, top-of-the atmosphere, and isentropic fields. Reanalysis information and selected output is also available on-line via the Internet A special CDROM, containing 13 years of selected observed, daily, monthly, and climatological data from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis, is included with this issue. Output variables are classified into four classes, depending on the degree to which they are influenced by the observations and/or the model. For example, ''C'' variables (such as precipitation and surface fluxes) are completely determined by the model during the data assimilation and should be used with caution. Nevertheless, a comparison of these variables with observations and with several climatologies shows that they generally contain considerable useful information. Eight-day forecasts, produced every 5 days, should be useful for predictability studies and for monitoring the quality of the observing systems. The 40 years of reanalysis (1957-96) should be completed in early 1997. A continuation into the future through an identical Climate Data Assimilation System will allow researchers to reliably compare recent anomalies with those in earlier decades. Since changes in the observing systems will inevitably produce perceived changes in the climate, parallel reanalyses (at least 1 year long) will be generated for the periods immediately after the introduction of new observing systems, such as new types of satellite data. NCEP plans currently call for an updated reanalysis using a state-of-the-art system every five years or so. The successive reanalyses will be greatly facilitated by the generation of the comprehensive database in the present reanalysis.},

abstract = {Abstract Using linear programming in bio-economic farm modelling often results in overspecialised model solutions. The positive mathematical programming (PMP) approach guarantees exact calibration to base year data but the forecasting capacity of the model is affected by necessary but arbitrary assumptions imposed during calibration. In this article, a new PMP variant is presented which is based on less arbitrary assumptions that, from a theoretical point of view, are closer to the actual decision making of the farmer. The PMP variant is evaluated according to the predictions of the bio-economic farm model, developed within the framework for integrated assessment of agricultural systems in Europe (SEAMLESS). The forecasting capacity of the model calibrated with the standard PMP approach and the alternative PMP variant, respectively, is tested in ex-post experiments for the arable farm types of Flevoland (the Netherlands) and Midi-Pyrenees (France). The results of the ex-post experiments, in which we try to simulate farm responses in 2003 using a model calibrated to 1999 data, show that the alternative PMP variant improves the forecasting capacity of the model in all tested cases.},

The hydrologic component is a detailed physics-based three-dimensional hydrodynamic model that simulates changes in the hydrologic system derived from agricultural activity while in turn providing biophysical constraints to the economic system. The linked models capture the effects of the interactions between the hydrologic and the economic systems at high spatial and temporal resolutions, ensuring that the model converges to an optimal economic scenario that takes into account the spatial and temporal distribution of the water resources. The operation and usefulness of the models are demonstrated in a rural catchment area of about 10 km2 within the S{\~{a}}o Francisco River Basin in Brazil. Two droughts of increasing intensity are simulated to investigate how farmers behave under rain shortfalls of different severity. The results show that farmers react to rainfall shortages to minimize their effects on farm profits, and that the impact on farmers depends, among other things, on their location in the watershed and on their access to groundwater.},

In this paper a high-resolution linked hydroeconomic model is demonstrated for drought conditions in a Brazilian river basin. The economic model of agriculture includes 13 decision variables that can be optimized to maximize farmers' yearly net revenues. The economic model uses a multi-input multioutput nonlinear constant elasticity of substitution (CES) production function simulating agricultural production. The hydrologic component is a detailed physics-based three-dimensional hydrodynamic model that simulates changes in the hydrologic system derived from agricultural activity while in turn providing biophysical constraints to the economic system. The linked models capture the effects of the interactions between the hydrologic and the economic systems at high spatial and temporal resolutions, ensuring that the model converges to an optimal economic scenario that takes into account the spatial and temporal distribution of the water resources.

abstract = {Microbial biomass, size and community structure along with an estimate of microbial activity and soil chemical parameters were determined at three depths in two soils (e.g. sandy loam Ultic Hapludalf and silt loam Mollic Hapludalf) replicated three times under one winter and summer season. Microbial biomass and community structure were estimated from phospholipid-PO4 content and fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) measurements. Microbial activity and assimilative capacity were estimated using a 3H-acetate incorporation into phospholipids and by incubating the soil samples at the average winter and summer temperatures, 3 and 20°C, respectively. We found that the size of the microbial biomass in both the surface and the subsurface soils was not significantly affected by the seasonal variation but activity increased by as much as 83{\%} at the summer temperatures in the surface soil. We demonstrated using FAME analysis that for both soils seasonal changes in the subsurface microbial community occurred. These findings suggest that winter conditions will shift the population activity level in both the surface and subsurface systems and the biochemical structure of the community in the subsurface. In all cases, the inorganic chemical properties of the soil, as a function of season, remained constant. The greatly increased activity of microbial population at the higher temperature will favor the capacity of the system to utilize nutrients or organic materials that may enter soil. During low temperature seasons the capacity of either surface or subsurface soils to assimilate materials is generally diminished but the reduction reflects changes in metabolism and not a reduced biomass size.},

abstract = {The generation and release of meltwater during the spring snowmelt season can be delayed because of spring storm episodes with snow accumulation and/or sustained subfreezing temperatures. The delayed release of snowmelt often extends beyond the particular storm event because of changes to the internal state of energy in the snowpack that prevents transmission of meltwater. Following a storm, two energy deficits internal to the snowpack must be overcome before surface melt can drain and exit the snowpack: 1) cold content created by heat lost during the episode must be removed and 2) dry pore space must be filled with liquid water to residual saturation. This study investigates the role of these two processes in spring snowmelt following past storm episodes in western Montana. The analysis addresses {\~{}}10 yr of historical snowpack and air temperature data from 33 stations in the Columbia River headwaters. Results indicate that the addition of pore space has a greater impact on delaying snowmelt than does the addition of cold content, with snow accumulation events responsible for 86{\%} of the collective energy deficit imposed on the snowpack during storm episodes. Nearly all refreezing events occur within one month of peak snowpack, but accumulation events are common up to 50 days later. Under standardized conditions representing clear weather during the spring season, these energy deficits could all be overcome in a matter of hours. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {We studied the effects of high temperature and drought on the survival, growth and water relations of seedlings of Pinus ponderosa (Dougl.) Lawson, one of few coniferous tree species that can successfully colonize drought-prone sites with high soil surface temperatures. Temperature profiles were measured with 0.07-mm thermocouples in a sparse ponderosa pine forest in northern Idaho. The soil surface and the adjacent 5 mm of air reached maximum temperatures exceeding 75 degrees C, well above the lethal temperature threshold for most plants. Air temperatures 50 mm above the soil surface (seedling needle height) rarely exceeded 45 degrees C. Pinus ponderosa seedlings that survived maintained basal stem temperatures as much as 15 degrees C lower than the surrounding air. The apparent threshold temperature at the seedling stem surface resulting in death was approximately 63 degrees C for less than 1 min. No correlation between seedling mortality and needle temperature was found, although some needles reached temperatures as high as 60 degrees C for periods of {\textless}/= 1 min. Surviving seedlings had significantly higher stomatal conductance than seedlings that did not survive until fall. Transpiration rates, calculated from measured needle temperatures, stomatal conductance and evaporative demand, were high (up to 16.7 mmol m(-2) s(-1)), indicating that water transport through seedling stems may have acted as a heat transfer mechanism, cooling the stem below the lethal threshold temperature. Heat exchange calculations showed that rapid water flow through seedling stems can absorb sufficient energy to reduce stem temperature by 30 degrees C during peak sunlight hours.},

abstract = {Understanding the temporal variance of evapotranspiration (ET) at the catchment scale remains a challenging task, because ET variance results from the complex interactions among climate, soil, vegetation, groundwater and human activities. This study extends the framework for ET variance analysis of Koster and Suarez (1999) by incorporating the water balance and the Budyko hypothesis. ET variance is decomposed into the variance/covariance of precipitation, potential ET, and catchment storage change. The contributions to ET variance from those components are quantified by long-term climate conditions (i.e., precipitation and potential ET) and catchment properties through the Budyko equation. It is found that climate determines ET variance under cool-wet, hot-dry and hot-wet conditions; while both catchment storage change and climate together control ET variance under cool-dry conditions. Thus the major factors of ET variance can be categorized based on the conditions of climate and catchment storage change. To demonstrate the analysis, both the inter- and intra-annul ET variances are assessed in the Murray-Darling Basin, and it is found that the framework corrects the over-estimation of ET variance in the arid basin. This study provides an extended theoretical framework to assess ET temporal variance under the impacts from both climate and storage change at the catchment scale.},

abstract = {A two-dimensional finite element based overland flow model was developed
and used to study the accuracy and stability of three numerical schemes
and watershed parameter aggregation error. The conventional consistent
finite element scheme results in oscillations for certain time step
ranges. The lumped and the upwind finite element schemes are tested
as alternatives to the consistent scheme. The upwind scheme did not
improve on the stability or the accuracy of the solution, while the
lumped scheme provided stable and accurate solutions for time steps
twice the size of time steps needed for the consistent scheme. A
new accuracy based dynamic time step estimate for the two-dimensional
overland flow kinematic wave solution is developed for the lumped
scheme. The newly developed dynamic time step estimates are functions
of the mesh size, and time of concentration of the watershed hydrograph.
Due to lack of analytical solutions, the time step was developed
by comparing numerical solutions of various levels of discretization
to a reference solution using a very fine mesh and a very small time
step. The time step criteria were tested on a different set of problems
and proved to be adequate for accurate and stable solutions. A sensitivity
analysis for the watershed slope, Manning's roughness coefficient
and excess rainfall rate was conducted in order to test the effect
of parameter aggregation on the stability and accuracy of the solution.
The results of this analysis show that aggregation of the slope data
resulted in the highest error. The roughness coefficient had a smaller
effect on the solution while the rainfall intensity did not show
any significant effect on the flow rate solution for the range of
rainfall intensity used. This work pioneers the challenge of providing
guidelines for accurate and stable numerical solutions of the two-dimensional
kinematic wave equations for overland flow.},

We demonstrate that observed streamflow declines are probably associated with declines in mountain precipitation, revealing previously unexplored differential trends. Lower-troposphere winter (November to March) westerlies are strongly correlated with high-elevation precipitation but weakly correlated with low-elevation precipitation. Decreases in lower-tropospheric winter westerlies across the region from 1950 to 2012 are hypothesized to have reduced orographic precipitation enhancement, yielding differential trends in precipitation across elevations and contributing to the decline in annual streamflow. Climate projections show weakened lower-troposphere zonal flow across the region under enhanced greenhouse forcing, highlighting an additional stressor that is relevant for climate change impacts on hydrology.},

@article{Anderegg2015,
abstract = {The projected responses of forest ecosystems to warming and drying associated with twenty-first-century climate change vary widely from resiliency to widespread tree mortality 1–3 . Current vegetation models lack the ability to account for mortality of overstorey trees during extreme drought owing to uncertainties in mechanisms and thresholds causing mortal-ity 4,5 . Here we assess the causes of tree mortality, using field measurements of branch hydraulic conductivity during ongoing mortality in Populus tremuloides in the southwestern United States and a detailed plant hydraulics model. We identify a lethal plant water stress threshold that corresponds with a loss of vascular transport capacity from air entry into the xylem. We then use this hydraulic-based threshold to simulate forest dieback during historical drought, and compare predictions against three independent mortality data sets. The hydraulic threshold predicted with 75{\%} accuracy regional patterns of tree mortality as found in field plots and mortality maps derived from Landsat imagery. In a high-emissions scenario, climate models project that drought stress will exceed the observed mortality threshold in the southwestern United States by the 2050s. Our approach provides a powerful and tractable way of incorporating tree mortality into vegetation models to resolve uncertainty over the fate of forest ecosystems in a changing climate. Forests play a central role in global water, energy and biogeochemical cycles and provide substantial ecosystem services to societies around the globe 6 . Yet the fate of forest ecosystems in a changing climate is highly uncertain. Rising atmospheric CO 2 concentrations may benefit trees, particularly through increasing water-use efficiency 7 , but concomitant increases in temperature and drought stress could potentially overwhelm these benefits, leading to widespread forest dieback in many ecosystems globally 8 . Although precipitation projections under climate scenarios are more variable and uncertain, general circulation models project consistent increases in air temperature and thus evaporation over much of the world and resulting decreases in soil moisture in many regions, leading to more intense and frequent droughts 9 . Recent studies have indicated resilience in forest biomes in response to early twenty-first-century droughts through inter-annual modulations in water-use efficiency 10 and long-term increases in forest water-use efficiency 7 . In contrast, severe regional droughts have strongly decreased the carbon sink of key forest ecosystems 11–13 and widespread, climate-induced tree mortality has been observed around the globe 8,14 . The balance of resiliency versus the potential for widespread forest dieback due to climatic extremes hinges in large part on poorly understood demographic processes, which are not well represented in most dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs). An increase in mortality rate can be as important as a change in productivity for carbon sinks 15 . Application of DGVMs to known severe drought stress in controlled rainfall exclusion experiments reveals that they do not accurately capture drought-induced forest dieback 5 . Thus, there is a compelling need for an approach to simulate spatial and temporal patterns of tree mortality and to test model predictions against regional mortality data sets, such as remote-sensing estimates 16 . This can then be a foundation for incorporating mortality algorithms into vegetation models that can be trusted for future projections of change, for instance when coupled to global circulation models. Trees die from drought and temperature stress through complex and poorly understood pathways of interrelated physiological failures that often interact with biotic agents 4,17 . Hydraulic failure through xylem cavitation has been shown to be a major mortality mechanism across a number of angiosperm species 18–20 . Using a combination of field physiological measurements, a plant hydraulic model 21 , a hydrologic model 22 , climate projections and multiple mortality data sets (Supplementary Fig. 1), we tested: does a hydraulic threshold as a function of drought stress emerge across forest sites during ongoing tree mortality; can this mechanistic-based threshold be used to hindcast patterns of mortality with reasonable accuracy compared to multiple mortality data sets; and what do global circulation model projections suggest for future trajectories of this drought stress and exceedance frequency of a mortality threshold? We examined a recent widespread, climate-induced forest die-off of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides; hereafter aspen) in 91,500 Ha in the southwestern United States. As the most widely distributed tree species in North America with major economic and ecological value 23 , aspen presents an ideal test case for modelling tree mortality. We quantified drought stress as climatic water deficit 24 (CWD)— the difference between plant water demand, which is determined by atmospheric water demand (here, potential evapotranspiration, PET), and plant water supply, which is determined in part by available soil moisture (here, actual evapotranspiration, AET). Owing to low precipitation and high temperatures, CWD reached peak values around 2000–2003, representing the severe drought that initiated ongoing tree mortality (Fig. 1).},

abstract = {Extremes of weather and climate can have devastating effects on human society and the environment. Understanding past changes in the characteristics of such events, including recent increases in the intensity of heavy precipitation events over a large part of the Northern Hemisphere land area, is critical for reliable projections of future changes. Given that atmospheric water-holding capacity is expected to increase roughly exponentially with temperature--and that atmospheric water content is increasing in accord with this theoretical expectation--it has been suggested that human-influenced global warming may be partly responsible for increases in heavy precipitation. Because of the limited availability of daily observations, however, most previous studies have examined only the potential detectability of changes in extreme precipitation through model-model comparisons. Here we show that human-induced increases in greenhouse gases have contributed to the observed intensification of heavy precipitation events found over approximately two-thirds of data-covered parts of Northern Hemisphere land areas. These results are based on a comparison of observed and multi-model simulated changes in extreme precipitation over the latter half of the twentieth century analysed with an optimal fingerprinting technique. Changes in extreme precipitation projected by models, and thus the impacts of future changes in extreme precipitation, may be underestimated because models seem to underestimate the observed increase in heavy precipitation with warming.},

long-term persistence of a holm oak tree layer. Managers of private
estates in Caceres province, Spain, were surveyed about their conservation
attitudes and behavior, especially as regards the widespread regeneration
failure of oak stands. The aim was to define land-user perspectives
on oak conservation in dehesas as basis for the design of suitable
oak regeneration programs. Dehesa estates are managed diversely for
a variety of goals, with lamb and beef production predominating.
Small operations ('minifundios') had significantly higher stocking
levels than large operations ('latifundios'). Results suggest that
managers strongly appreciate oaks, both for income- and non-income-related
motivations like the preservation of real estate value or family
tradition. Concern about threats to oak stands like lacking regeneration,
oak decline, or conversion in urban areas varied in intensity, but
most managers expected major changes for the future. Statistical
relationships were established between oak appreciation and socio-economic
variables like age, land ownership, years the operation had been
owned by the family, and use of oak products. The survey revealed
great confusion about existing oak conservation regulations. For
long-term support to be assured, policy should orient its efforts
toward conservation incentive schemes, environmental education, and
technical assistance.},

the surface runoff by integrating the unsteady motion equations of
a gradually varied free surface flow according to a finite difference
scheme of explicit type. In the momentum equation the convective
inertia term is ignored. The infiltration is schematized through
the physically based equation of Green and Ampt. Preliminary validation
of the model is made on the basis of field data available in the
literature.Border irrigation tests were carried out on 40 and 100
m long plots and measurements were made of advance times of the wave
front and surface runoff volumes. The initial conditions were defined
by measurement of the soil water content just before watering. The
changes of the ground cover and the decrease of porosity along the
soil profile owing to ploughing and to the formation of a plough
sole are found to exert an important influence on the runoff.The
sensitivity analysis of the model, carried out taking into account
the wave front celerity, the discharge hydrograph at the end of the
plot and the outflow volume, confirms the prevailing influence of
roughness coefficient and natural hydraulic conductivity compared
with the wetting front suction. According to the single-parameter
perturbation technique, decreasing the values of roughness coefficient
and hydraulic conductivity individually, compared with the calibration
values, increases the computed outflow volumes by nearly 400{\%} compared

Irrigated areas constitute 40 {\%} of the total area used for agricultural production (FAO, 2014a) Information on their spatial distribution is highly relevant for regional water management and food security. Spatial information on irrigation is highly important for policy and decision makers, who are facing the transition towards more efficient sustainable agriculture. However, the mapping of irrigated areas still represents a challenge for land use classifications, and existing global data sets differ strongly in their results. The following study tests an existing irrigation map based on statistics and extends the irrigated area using ancillary data. The approach processes and analyzes multi-temporal normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) SPOT-VGT data and agricultural suitability data {\&}ndash; both at a spatial resolution of 30 arcsec {\&}ndash; incrementally in a multiple decision tree. It covers the period from 1999 to 2012. The results globally show a 18 {\%} larger irrigated area than existing approaches based on statistical data. The largest differences compared to the official national statistics are found in Asia and particularly in China and India. The additional areas are mainly identified within already known irrigated regions where irrigation is more dense than previously estimated. The validation with global and regional products shows the large divergence of existing data sets with respect to size and distribution of irrigated areas caused by spatial resolution, the considered time period and the input data and assumption made.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

surface water and energy balances. Particular focus is applied to
the soil moisture controls on wet-end drainage and dry-end transpiration,
and the integrated effects of these controls on the structure of
soil moisture time series. Analysis is centered on data collected
during a pair of field experiments, where a site in Virginia (USA)
provides evidence of dynamics under dry conditions and a site in
Cork (Ireland) captures dynamics under wet conditions. It is demonstrated
that drainage processes (controlled by the saturated hydraulic conductivity)
determine the magnitude of soil moisture at the start of the drying
process and hence affect uniformly the entire distribution of soil
moisture, from wet to dry. Therefore, stationary bias between predicted
and measured soil moisture can be evidence of a bias in the saturated
conductivity. In contrast to this, the dry-end soil controls on transpiration
affect predominantly the dry-end of the soil moisture distribution,
as subsequent storms act to reset the system and remove the memory
of the dry state. Hence, analysis of departure between predicted
and measured soil moisture that is local to the dry-end can guide
estimation of the soil moisture level at which transpiration becomes
limited by water availability. The temporal statistics of soil moisture
are shown to exhibit threshold response to the specification of saturated
conductivity in land surface models. Finally, we demonstrate the
relative influences of saturated conductivity and precipitation intensity
on the structural features of the root-zone soil moisture distribution.},

This paper evaluates remote sensing approaches for mapping crop phenology using vegetation index time-series generated by fusing Landsat and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) surface reflectance imagery to improve temporal sampling over that provided by Landsat alone. The case study focuses on an agricultural region in central Iowa from 2001 to 2014. Our objectives are 1) to assess Landsat-MODIS data fusion results over cropland; 2) to map crop phenology at 30 m resolution using fused surface reflectance data; and 3) to identify the relationships between remotely sensed crop phenology metrics and the crop progress stages reported by NASS. The results show that detailed spatial and temporal variability in vegetation development across this landscape can be identified using the fused Landsat-MODIS data. The mean difference (bias) in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) between actual Landsat observations and the fused Landsat-MODIS data, generated for Landsat overpass dates, is in the range of − 0.011 to 0.028 for every year. The derived phenological metrics show distinct features for different crops and natural vegetation at field scales. Strong correlations are observed between remotely sensed phenological stages, based on NDVI curve inflection points, and the observed crop physiological growth stages from the NASS Crop Progress (CP) reports. The green-up dates detected from remote sensing data typically occurred during crop vegetative stages when 2–4 leaves were developed for both corn and soybeans, or about 1–3 weeks after the reported emergence dates when the plant were first visible to ground-based observers. Despite being a lagging indicator, remotely sensed green-up can be used effectively to backcast emergence, e.g. as input to spatially distributed crop models. The differences in green-up date between corn and soybean were 8–10 days, consistent with the offset in emergence dates reported by NASS at district level. The reported harvest dates were typically about 2–3 weeks after the dormancy stage was detected via remote sensing for corn and about 1–2 weeks for soybeans. This suggests that probable harvest times for individual fields may be predicted 1–3 weeks ahead using remote sensing data. The results suggest that crop phenology and certain growth stages at field scales (30 m spatial resolution) can be linked and mapped by integrating imagery from multiple remote sensing platforms.},

abstract = {AbstractDrought indices are often used for monitoring interannual variability in macroscale hydrology. However, the diversity of drought indices raises several issues: 1) which indices perform best and where; 2) does the incorporation of potential evapotranspiration (PET) in indices strengthen relationships, and how sensitive is the choice of PET methods to such results; 3) what additional value is added by using higher-spatial-resolution gridded climate layers; and 4) how have observed relationships changed through time. Standardized precipitation index, standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), Palmer drought severity index, and water balance runoff (WBR) model output were correlated to water-year runoff for 21 unregulated drainage basins in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. SPEI and WBR with time scales encompassing the primary precipitation season maximized the explained variance in water-year runoff in most basins. Slightly stronger correlations were found using PET estima...},

abstract = {Diel fluctuations can comprise a significant portion of summer discharge in small to medium catchments. The source of these signals and the manner in which they are propagated to stream gauging sites is poorly understood. In this work, we analysed stream discharge from 15 subcatchments in Dry Creek, Idaho, Reynolds Creek, Idaho, and HJ Andrews, Oregon. We identified diel signals in summer low flow, determined the lag between diel signals and evapotranspiration demand and identified seasonal trends in the evolution of the lag at each site. The lag between vegetation water use and streamflow response increases throughout summer at each subcatchment, with the rate of increase as a function of catchment stream length and other catchment characteristics such as geology, vegetation and stream geomorphology. These findings support the hypothesis that variations in stream velocity are the key control on the seasonal evolution of the observed lags.

abstract = {Baseflow and precipitation in the Kickapoo River Watershed, located in the Driftless Area of Wisconsin, exhibit a step increase around 1970, similar to minimum and median flows in many other central and eastern USA streams. Potential effects on streamflow due to climatic and land management changes were evaluated by comparing volumetric changes in the hydrologic budget before and after 1970. Increases in precipitation do not fully account for the increase in baseflow, which appears to be offset by a volumetric decrease in stormflow. This suggests that factors that influence the partitioning of precipitation into overland runoff or infiltration have changed. A transition from relatively more intensive to relatively less intensive agricultural land use is generally associated with higher infiltration rates, and likely influences partitioning of flow. Changes in agricultural land management practices in the Driftless Area, which began in the mid-1930s, do not coincide with the abrupt increase in baseflow around 1970. Instead, the timing of hydrologic change appears to coincide with changes in precipitation, whereas the magnitude of the change in baseflow and stormflow was likely amplified by changes in agricultural land management.},

[1] Observed changes in the timing of snowmelt dominated streamflow in the western United States are often linked to anthropogenic or other external causes. We assess whether observed streamflow timing changes can be statistically attributed to external forcing, or whether they still lie within the bounds of natural ( internal) variability for four large Sierra Nevada ( CA) basins, at inflow points to major reservoirs. Streamflow timing is measured by "center timing'' (CT), the day when half the annual flow has passed a given point. We use a physically based hydrology model driven by meteorological input from a global climate model to quantify the natural variability in CT trends. Estimated 50-year trends in CT due to natural climate variability often exceed estimated actual CT trends from 1950 to 1999. Thus, although observed trends in CT to date may be statistically significant, they cannot yet be statistically attributed to external influences on climate. We estimate that projected CT changes at the four major reservoir inflows will, with 90{\%} confidence, exceed those from natural variability within 1 - 4 decades or 4 - 8 decades, depending on rates of future greenhouse gas emissions. To identify areas most likely to exhibit CT changes in response to rising temperatures, we calculate changes in CT under temperature increases from 1 to 5 degrees. We find that areas with average winter temperatures between -2 degrees C and -4 degrees C are most likely to respond with significant CT shifts. Correspondingly, elevations from 2000 to 2800 m are most sensitive to temperature increases, with CT changes exceeding 45 days ( earlier) relative to 1961 - 1990.

EcH2O-iso is evaluated at a montane, low-energy experimental catchment in eastern Scotland using 16 independent isotope time series from various landscape positions and compartments; encompassing soil water, groundwater, stream water, and plant xylem. We find a good model-observation match in most cases, despite having only calibrated the model using hydrometric data and energy fluxes. These results provide further validation of the physical basis of the model for successfully capturing catchment hydrological functioning, both in terms of the celerity in energy propagation (e.g. runoff generation under prevailing hydraulic gradients) and flow velocities of water molecules (e.g., in consistent tracer concentrations at given locations and times). We also show that the spatially-distributed formulation of EcH2O-iso provides a powerful tool for quantitatively linking water stores and fluxes with spatio-temporal patterns of isotopes ratios and water ages. Finally, our study highlights some model development and benchmarking needs, refined using isotope-based calibration, for hypothesis testing and improved simulations of catchment dynamics that is transferable beyond the catchment landscape studied here.},

The goal of this study is to quantify the storage capacity and the timing of recharge and discharge in a partially glaciated, first-order watershed in the Canadian Rockies using detailed measurements of hydrological input and output fluxes. We computed daily input fluxes from direct measurements of snow accumulation at 1300 points within the watershed near the peak accumulation date, time-lapse photography during the melt season, and high-resolution (25m) snowmelt simulation using a field-validated snowmelt energy balance model; and estimated the amount and timing of water storage within the watershed from the water balance. The peak storage amount was on the order of 60–100mm averaged over the watershed, which was relatively small compared to the pre-melt snow water equivalent in the watershed (500–640mm), but significant in comparison to the fall and winter baseflow ({\textless}0.5mmd−1) sustaining the aquatic ecosystem. This is an important finding demonstrating the critical role of groundwater storage and delayed release in alpine environments, which generally have little soil water storage.},

abstract = {Since March 2002, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) has provided first estimates of land water storage variations by monitoring the time-variable component of Earth's gravity field. Here we characterize spatial-temporal variations in terrestrial water storage changes (TWSC) from GRACE and compare them to those simulated with the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS). Additionally, we use GLDAS simulations to infer how TWSC is partitioned into snow, canopy water and soil water components, and to understand how variations in the hydrologic fluxes act to enhance or dissipate the stores. Results quantify the range of GRACE-derived storage changes during the studied period and place them in the context of seasonal variations in global climate and hydrologic extremes including drought and flood, by impacting land memory processes. The role of the largest continental river basins as major locations for freshwater redistribution is highlighted. GRACE-based storage changes are in good agreement with those obtained from GLDAS simulations. Analysis of GLDAS-simulated TWSC illustrates several key characteristics of spatial and temporal land water storage variations. Global averages of TWSC were partitioned nearly equally between soil moisture and snow water equivalent, while zonal averages of TWSC revealed the importance of soil moisture storage at low latitudes and snow storage at high latitudes. Evapotranspiration plays a key role in dissipating globally averaged terrestrial water storage. Latitudinal averages showed how precipitation dominates TWSC variations in the tropics, evapotranspiration is most effective in the midlatitudes, and snowmelt runoff is a key dissipating flux at high latitudes. Results have implications for monitoring water storage response to climate variability and change, and for constraining land model hydrology simulations.},

abstract = {In this study, a fully-coupled surface–subsurface, distributed, physics-based hydrological model was calibrated using the pilot-point method. A minimum variance field rule was included in the objective function to regularize the extensive calibration exercise that included 74 parameters (72 associated with pilot points and two spatially-invariant channel parameters). Because the overland and vadose zone systems are not in permanent hydrological connection, the information contained in the observation points may not be accessible by the pilot points at all times, rendering them insensitive to the observations and hindering the calibration process. An anal-ysis of the spatial and temporal variability of parameter sensitivities was done to explore how the information contained in local observations spreads from the observation points to the pilot points, where parameter values are identified. The results show that the channel flow time series is valuable to identify the parameters at all pilot-point locations, indicating that the information in channel flow propagates to the entire basin. However, information in soil moisture measurements is of local extent and thus only valuable to identify the parameters at locations close to the observation point.

abstract = {Abstract: [ 1] Hydrographs from shallow wells in vegetated riparian zones frequently display a distinctive pattern of diurnal water table fluctuations produced by variations in plant water use. A multisite investigation assessed the major controls on these fluctuations and the ecohydrologic insights that can be gleaned from them. Spatial and temporal variations in the amplitude of the fluctuations are primarily a function of variations in ( 1) the meteorological drivers of plant water use, ( 2) vegetation density, type, and vitality, and ( 3) the specific yield of sediments in the vicinity of the water table. Past hydrologic conditions experienced by the riparian zone vegetation, either in previous years or earlier within the same growing season, are also an important control. Diurnal water table fluctuations can be considered a diagnostic indicator of groundwater consumption by phreatophytes at most sites, so the information embedded within these fluctuations should be more widely exploited in ecohydrologic studies.},

An economic-engineering network flow optimization model, CALVIN, is used to analyze the economic and reliability benefits from different conjunctive use alternatives. Flexible management of additional conjunctive use facilities and groundwater storage capacity under flexible water allocation can generate substantial economic benefits to the region. Conjunctive use adds operational flexibility to take better advantage of water market transfers, and transfers provide the allocation flexibility to take better advantage of conjunctive use. The value of conjunctive use programs along the Colorado River Aqueduct, in Coachella Valley, and north of the Tehachapi Mountains under economically optimized operation of the system is examined. Results reveal reductions of economic demand for increased imports into southern California, suggest changes in the system operations, and indicate significant economic benefits from expanding some conveyance and storage facilities.},

@article{Ritter1992,
abstract = {The sophistication and use of distributed hydrologic models are increasing
at the expense of data collection and field experimentation upon
which such models were conceptualized and parameterized. The purpose
of this study is to explore the use of field data, collected from
reclaimed surface mines, in the parameterization of ANSWERS, a distributed
hydrologic model. A sensitivity analysis of ANSWERS was conducted
at two scales, the plot scale (2), typically the scale at which field
data are collected, and the drainage basin scale (0.1-0.3 km2), the
size of reclaimed surface mine basins. The results of this analysis
indicate that at both plot and basin scale, the most sensitive parameter
of the ANSWERS hydrologic model with respect to the volume and peak
rate of hillslope runoff and basin discharge is steady-state infiltration
capacity (FC), a variable that can be measured directly from a dripping-rainfall
infiltrometer test. At the plot scale, the time to FC (Tfc) is most
sensitive to two parameters that control the rate of decay of the
infiltration curve, namely, surface roughness (RN) and a dimensionless
coefficient (P) relating infiltration capacity to soil moisture.
By measuring FC from infiltrometer tests and adjusting RN and P by
visually fitting simulated infiltration curves to field infiltrometer-derived
infiltration curves, the ANSWERS model can be parameterized, in part,
at the plot scale for hydrologic simulation at the basin scale. At
the basin scale, the time to peak discharge (Tp) of the simulated
hydrograph is dependent primarily on accurate representation of the
drainage network, a function of the element size selected to characterize
the distribution of model parameters in the basin. Model performance
was evaluated in two reclaimed surface mine basins, one dominated
by infiltration-excess overland flow and the other by saturation
overland flow.ANSWERS is most appropriately suited for drainage basins
dominated by infiltration-excess overland flow because it is physically
based with respect to infiltration, overland flow, and channelized
flow processes. In these basins a field program of infiltrometer
tests, designed to include representative basin surfaces with respect
to soil and surface properties, is sufficient for model parameterization
in order to supplement existing hydrologic data or to evaluate the
probable hydrologic consequence of a land-use change. In drainage
basins dominated by saturation overland flow, subsurface flow contribution
to simulated hydrographs, described by the lumped parameter GRF,
must presently be calibrated against observed storm hydrographs.
Model parameterization is accomplished by augmenting the infiltration-excess
component of the simulated hydrograph, determined by the above parameterization
technique, with a specified proportion (GRF) of the infiltrated water.
The lumped parameter GRF is problematic in the sense that it is sensitive
to infiltration capacity as well as storm size and intensity and,
therefore, must be calibrated for characteristic storm events. However,
the ANSWERS model is recommended for further evaluation and use in
surface mine environments, which are initially dominated by infiltration-excess
overland flow due to low infiltration capacities of newly reclaimed
mine soils.},

The aim of this research was to evaluate the use of ecotoxicity assays with Daphnia magna and Danio rerio as alert systems in water contaminated with toxic substances. Using two toxicity databases, the sensibility of those aquatic organisms to a wide variety of chemical products and elements and to some chemical categories was investigated. The relation between the reference dose for human oral chronic exposure (RfD) of all chemical products and the acute toxicity values for both bioindicators was also studied. Acute toxicity tests with D. magna respond to a larger variety of chemicals with a higher sensitivity than those with D. rerio. Although mammals, crustaceans and fish have different routes of exposure, target organs and toxic mechanisms, acute toxicity essays with fish and Daphnia may be used as an initial screening before mammal models are used.},

abstract = {Although many studies have investigated the effects of forest cover oil streamflow and runoff, and several have examined the effects of canopy density oil snowpack accumulation, the impacts of forest canopy density oil spatial patterns of snowmelt input to catchments remain relatively underquantified. We performed all intensive snow depth and density survey during maximum accumulation in a mid-latitude montane environment in northern New Mexico, taking 900 snow depth measurements and excavating six snow pits across a continuum of canopy densities. Snow water equivalent (SWE) data are correlated with forest canopy density (R-2 = 0.21, p {\textless} 0.0001), with maximum snow accumulation in forests with density between 25 and 40{\%}. Forest edges are shown to be highly influential on patterns of snow depth, with unforested areas shaded by forest to their immediate south holding approximately 25{\%} deeper snow than either large open areas or densely forested areas. This indicates that the combination of canopy influences oil throughfall and snowpack shading are key processes underlying snow distribution in the high solar load environments typical of mountainous, mid-latitude areas. We further show that statistical models of snow distribution are improved with the addition of remotely sensed forest canopy information (R 2 increased in 10 of 11 cases, deviance lowered in 9 of 11 cases), making these findings broadly relevant for improving estimation of water resources, predicting the ecohydrological implications of vegetation and climate change, and informing, integrated forest and water resources management.

abstract = {We studied post-dispersive losses of holm-oak acorns (Quercus ilex
subsp. ballota) due to wild and domestic ungulates and to small mammals
in two types of Mediterranean ecosystems in south-western Spain,
savannah-like forests, locally named dehesa, and shrublands. Savannah-like
forests which are used for sheep and cattle grazing and for acorn
fattening of Iberian pig show a lack of oak regeneration. However,
these ecosystems are considered as a model of sustainable resource
use in all the fragile area of the Mediterranean region. During the
2 years, 1999 and 2000, we carried out a field experiment in three
savannah-like forest and three shrubland sites. At each site, we
added marked acorns and studied their loss from plots that were either
accessible to any animal (no exclosure), protected against ungulates
but accessible to small mammals (partial exclosure), or protected
against big and small mammals and other vertebrates (complete exclosure).
Results indicated that in the no exclosure treatment (i.e., the normal
environment) acorn recovery was very low at any site (0-2.4{\%}) without
significant differences between savannah-like forests and shrublands.
In the partial exclosure treatment, with small mammals having access
to the plots only, acorn recovery varied from 0 to 42{\%}. In this treatment,
acorn recovery tended to be higher in the savannah-like forests (0.5-42{\%})
when compared to the shrubland sites (0-2.5{\%}). However, the three
savannah-like forest sites, in different years, experienced {\textgreater}92{\%}
of acorn loss due to small mammals. In addition, many complete exclosures
were disrupted, presumably by rodents, and lost 60{\%} of the acorns.
These results indicate that loss of acorns due to small mammals is
very important in the two type of ecosystems, suggesting that proper
management of oak self-regeneration in Mediterranean savannah-like
forests should take into account the effect of small mammals, as
well as livestock, especially during the seeding stage.},

abstract = {Understanding of the processes that control CO2 concentrations in the aquatic environment has been hampered by the absence of a direct method to make continuous measurements over both short- and long-term time intervals. We describe an in situ method in which a non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) sensor is enclosed in a water impermeable, gas permeable polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane and deployed in a freshwater environment. This allows measurements of CO2 concentration to be made directly at a specific depth in the water column without the need for pumps or reagents. We demonstrate the potential of the method using examples from different aquatic environments characterized by a range of CO2 concentrations (0.5–8.0 mg CO2-C L-1, equivalent to ca 40–650 $\mu$mol CO2 L-1). These comprise streams and ponds from tropical, temperate and boreal regions. Data derived from the sensor was compared with direct measurements of CO2 concentrations using headspace analysis. Sensor performance following long-term ({\textgreater}6 months) field deployment conformed to manufacturers' specifications, with no drift detected. We conclude that the sensor-based method is a robust, accurate and responsive method, with a wide range of potential applications, particularly when combined with other in situ sensor-based measurements of related variables.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to evaluate the impacts of agriculture and water policy scenarios on the sustainability of selected irrigated farming systems in Italy, in the context of the forthcoming implementation of the directive EC 60/2000. Directive EC 60/2000 (Water Framework Directive) is intended to represent the reference norm regulating water use throughout Europe. Five main scenarios were developed reflecting aspects of agricultural policy, markets and technologies: Agenda 2000, world market, global sustainability, provincial agriculture and local community. These were combined with two water price levels, representing stylised scenarios for water policy. The effects of the scenarios on irrigated systems were simulated using multi-attribute linear programming models representing the reactions of the farms to external variables defined by each scenario. The output of the models consists of economic, social and environmental indicators aimed at quantifying the impact of the scenarios on different aspects of sustainability relevant for irrigated farming systems. Five Italian irrigated farming systems were considered: cereal, rice, fruit, vegetables and citrus. The results show the diversity of irrigated systems and the different effects that water pricing policy may produce depending on the agricultural policy, market and technological scenarios. They also highlight a clear trade-off between socio-economic sustainability and environmental (water, nitrogen, pesticide) sustainability. Water pricing will have, in most cases, less impact than agricultural markets and policy scenarios, though it appears to be an effective instrument for water regulation in the least intensive irrigated systems considered. This emphasises the need for a differentiated application of the Water Framework Directive at the local level as well as a more careful balance of water conservation, agricultural policy and rural development objectives.},

abstract = {In recent years there has been a dramatic increase in the demand for timely, comprehensive global agricultural intelligence. Timely information on global crop production is indispensable for combating the growing stress on the world's crop production and for securing both short-term and long-term stable and reliable supply of food. Global agriculture monitoring systems are critical to providing this kind of intelligence and global earth observations are an essential component of an effective global agricultural monitoring system as they offer timely, objective, global information on croplands distribution, crop development and conditions as the growing season progresses. The Global Agriculture Monitoring Project (GLAM), a joint NASA, USDA, UMD and SDSU initiative, has built a global agricultural monitoring system that provides the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) with timely, easily accessible, scientifically-validated remotely-sensed data and derived products as well as data analysis tools, for 
crop-condition monitoring and production assessment. This system is an integral component of the USDA's FAS Decision Support System (DSS) for agriculture. It has significantly improved the FAS crop analysts' ability to monitor crop conditions, and to quantitatively forecast crop yields through the provision of timely, high-quality global earth observations data in a format customized for FAS alongside a suite of data analysis tools. FAS crop analysts use these satellite data in a ‘convergence of evidence' approach with meteorological data, field reports, crop models, attach{\'{e}} reports and local reports. The USDA FAS is currently the only operational provider of timely, objective crop production forecasts at the global scale. These forecasts are routinely used by the other US Federal government agencies as well as by commodity trading companies, farmers, relief agencies and foreign governments.

Topic 3 pre- sents projections of future climate change and related impacts un- der different scenarios. Topic 4 discusses adaptation and mitigation options over the next few decades and their interactions with sustainable develop- ment. Topic 5 assesses the relationship between adaptation and mitigation on a more conceptual basis and takes a longer-term per- spective. Topic 6 summarises the major robust findings and remain- ing key uncertainties in this assessment. A schematic framework representing anthropogenic drivers, impacts of and responses to climate change, and their linkages, is shown in Figure I.1. At the time of the Third Assessment Report (TAR) in 2001, information was mainly available to describe the linkages clockwise, i.e. to derive climatic changes and impacts from socio-economic information and emissions. With increased under- standing of these linkages, it is now possible to assess the linkages also counterclockwise, i.e. to evaluate possible development path- ways and global emissions constraints that would reduce the risk of future impacts that society may wish to avoid.},

Method of estimating groundwater supplies based on discharge by plants and evaporation from soil - results of investigation in Escalante Valley, Utah - US Geological Survey. Water Supply Paper 659-A, 1-105] an empirical and hydraulic version of a new technique were developed to calculate evapotranspiration (ET) from groundwater level readings in the riparian zone. The method was tested with hydrometeorological data from the Hidegv{\'{i}}z Valley experimental catchment, located in the Sopron Hills region at the western border of Hungary. ET rates of the proposed method lag behind those of the Penman-Monteith method but otherwise the two estimates compare favorably for the day. At nights, the new technique yields more realistic values than the Penman-Monteith equation. On a daily basis the newly-derived ET rates are typically 50{\%} higher than the ones obtainable with the original White method. Sensitivity analysis showed that the more reliable hydraulic version of our ET estimation technique is most sensitive (i.e., linearly) to the laboratory- and/or slug-test derived values of the saturated hydraulic conductivity and specific yield taken from the riparian zone. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Concern about water scarcity and adverse climate events over agricultural regions has motivated a number of efforts to develop operational integrated hydroeconomic models to guide adaptation and optimal use of water. Once calibrated, these models are used for water management and analysis assuming they remain valid under future conditions. In this paper, we present and demonstrate a methodology that permits the recursive calibration of economic models of agricultural production from noisy but frequently available data. We use a standard economic calibration approach, namely positive mathematical programming, integrated in a data assimilation algorithm based on the ensemble Kalman filter equations to identify the economic model parameters. A moving average kernel ensures that new and past information on agricultural activity are blended during the calibration process, avoiding loss of information and overcalibration for the conditions of a single year. A regularization constraint akin to the standard Tikhonov regularization is included in the filter to ensure its stability even in the presence of parameters with low sensitivity to observations. The results show that the implementation of the PMP methodology within a data assimilation framework based on the enKF equations is an effective method to calibrate models of agricultural production even with noisy information. The recursive nature of the method incorporates new information as an added value to the known previous observations of agricultural activity without the need to store historical information. The robustness of the method opens the door to the use of new remote sensing algorithms for operational water management.

abstract = {One hundred and thirty six experiments were conducted on runoff plots
on semiarid grassland and shrubland hillslopes at Walnut Gulch, Arizona.
Graphs of Darcy-Weisbach friction factor f against Reynolds number
Re are positively sloping or convex-upward for the grassland and
predominantly negatively sloping for the shrubland. These trends
are attributed to the progressive inundation of the roughness elements,
with the submergence of the gravel on the shrubland being greater
than the submergence of the plants on the grassland.The f-Re relations
are of little value as models for predicting flow resistance at locations
other than where they were developed because each location has its
own unique relation which is a function of the surface properties
at that location. Consequently, multivariate models that include
surface properties among their predictive variables were derived
for the grassland and shrubland hillslopes using multiple regression
analysis. On the grassland 69.5{\%} of the variation in f is accounted
for by basal plant stem and litter cover, whereas on the shrubland
56.3{\%} of the variation is explained by gravel cover and gravel size.
The inclusion of Re improves the explained variation by 5.4{\%} on the
grassland and 7.6{\%} on the shrubland. These results suggest that for
most purposes the extra effort involved in measuring or modeling
flow rate is not worth the small improvement in predictive accuracy
and, therefore, that the practice of estimating resistance to overland
flow solely on the basis of surface properties is entirely reasonable.A
comparison of the two sets of experiments reveals that both infiltration
and resistance to flow are higher on grassland than shrubland. Consequently,
where shrubland has replaced grassland during the past century, in
addition to the ground surface becoming more exposed to raindrop
impact, overland flow has increased in volume and velocity. Together
these changes have resulted in accelerated erosion in the form of
rill development and stripping of the soil A horizon.},

abstract = {Broad-scale studies of climate change effects on freshwater species have focused mainly on temperature, ignoring critical drivers such as flow regime and biotic interactions. We use downscaled outputs from general circulation models coupled with a hydrologic model to forecast the effects of altered flows and increased temperatures on four interacting species of trout across the interior western United States (1.01 million km(2)), based on empirical statistical models built from fish surveys at 9,890 sites. Projections under the 2080s A1B emissions scenario forecast a mean 47{\%} decline in total suitable habitat for all trout, a group of fishes of major socioeconomic and ecological significance. We project that native cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii, already excluded from much of its potential range by nonnative species, will lose a further 58{\%} of habitat due to an increase in temperatures beyond the species' physiological optima and continued negative biotic interactions. Habitat for nonnative brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis and brown trout Salmo trutta is predicted to decline by 77{\%} and 48{\%}, respectively, driven by increases in temperature and winter flood frequency caused by warmer, rainier winters. Habitat for rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, is projected to decline the least (35{\%}) because negative temperature effects are partly offset by flow regime shifts that benefit the species. These results illustrate how drivers other than temperature influence species response to climate change. Despite some uncertainty, large declines in trout habitat are likely, but our findings point to opportunities for strategic targeting of mitigation efforts to appropriate stressors and locations.},

@article{Sivakumar2000,
abstract = {The application of the concept of chaos theory in hydrology has been
gaining considerable interest in recent times. However, studies reporting
the existence of chaos in hydrological processes are often criticized
due to the fundamental assumptions with which the chaos identification
methods have been developed, i.e. infinite and noise-free time series,
and the inherent limitations of the hydrological time series, i.e.
finite and noisy. This paper is designed: (1) to address some of
the important issues in the application of chaos theory in hydrology;
and (2) to provide possible interpretations to the results reported
by past studies reporting chaos in hydrological processes. A brief
review of some of the past studies investigating chaos in hydrological
processes is presented. An insight into the studies reveals that
most of the problems, such as data size, noise, delay time, in the
application of chaos theory have been addressed by past studies,
and caution taken in the application of the methods and interpretation
of the results. The study also reveals that the problem of data size
is not as severe as it was assumed to be, whereas the presence of
noise seems to have much more influence on the nonlinear prediction
method than the correlation dimension method. The study indicates
that the presence of noise in the data could be an important reason
for the low-prediction accuracy estimates achieved in some of the
past studies. These observations, with the fact that most of the
past studies used the correlation dimension either as a proof or
as a preliminary evidence of chaos, suggest that the hypothesis of
deterministic chaos, as the basis in those studies, for hydrological
processes is valid and has great practical potential.},

Average global yields for these commodities are determined by the performance of crops in millions of fields distributed across a range of management, soil and climate regimes. Despite the complexity of global food supply, here we show that simple measures of growing season temperatures and precipitation—spatial averages based on the locations of each crop—explain {\~{}}30{\%} or more of year-to-year variations in global average yields for the world's six most widely grown crops. For wheat, maize and barley, there is a clearly negative response of global yields to increased temperatures. Based on these sensitivities and observed climate trends, we estimate that warming since 1981 has resulted in annual combined losses of these three crops representing roughly 40 Mt or {\$}5 billion per year, as of 2002. While these impacts are small relative to the technological yield gains over the same period, the results demonstrate already occurring negative impacts of climate trends on crop yields at the global scale.},

These results have implications for large-scale studies that require ground observations for updating purposes; we show an example of this utility using the SWE product of the National Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center. Furthermore, the relatively consistent spatial patterns of snow accumulation and melt have implications for future observation network design in that results from short-term studies (e.g., 2 years) can be used to design long-term observation networks.},

abstract = {AbstractThis article developed and implemented a new methodology for calculating the Standardized Evapotranspiration Deficit Index (SEDI) globally based on the log-logistic distribution to fit the evaporation deficit (ED), the difference between actual evapotranspiration (ETa) and atmospheric evaporative demand (AED). Our findings demonstrate that, regardless of the AED dataset used, a log-logistic distribution most optimally fitted the ED time series. As such, in many regions across the terrestrial globe, the SEDI is insensitive to the AED method used for calculation, with the exception of winter months and boreal regions. The SEDI showed significant correlations (p {\textless} 0.05) with the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) across a wide range of regions, particularly for short ({\textless} 3-months) SPEI time-scales. This work provides a robust approach for calculating spatially and temporally comparable SEDI estimates, regardless of the climate region and land surface conditions, and it assesses...},

abstract = {Changes in the global production of major crops are important drivers of food prices, food security and land use decisions. Average global yields for these commodities are determined by the performance of crops in millions of fields distributed across a range of management, soil and climate regimes. Despite the complexity of global food supply, here we show that simple measures of growing season temperatures and precipitation—spatial averages based on the locations of each crop—explain {\~{}}30{\%} or more of year-to-year variations in global average yields for the world's six most widely grown crops. For wheat, maize and barley, there is a clearly negative response of global yields to increased temperatures. Based on these sensitivities and observed climate trends, we estimate that warming since 1981 has resulted in annual combined losses of these three crops representing roughly 40 Mt or {\$}5 billion per year, as of 2002. While these impacts are small relative to the technological yield gains over the same period, the results demonstrate already occurring negative impacts of climate trends on crop yields at the global scale.},

Hydrol.) recently reported a peculiar phase-shift in diurnal streamflow and riparian zone groundwater-level fluctuations during streamflow recession for a small forested watershed. Employing high-frequency (10 min) groundwater-level and streamflow measurements in a wooded riparian zone of a gaining stream they demonstrated that groundwater-level changes lagged behind that of streamflow changes by about 1-1.5 h. To check the validity of their claim, a 2D finite element numerical model of the coupled system of vadose and saturated zones was employed with diurnal fluctuations in evapotranspiration. The model successfully reproduced the reported phase-shift and produced diurnal groundwater and streamflow fluctuations similar in their characteristics to what was reported. This finding demonstrates that by observing a similar phase-shift in diurnal fluctuations between high-frequency streamflow rate (or stream stage) and groundwater-level measurements during recession flow conditions, does not, in itself, indicate that the stream section is a losing one. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {All data assimilation systems are affected by biases, caused by problems with the data, by approximations in the observation operators used to simulate the data, by limitations of the assimilating model, or by the assimilation methodology itself. A clear symptom of bias in the assimilation is the presence of systematic features in the analysis increments, such as large persistent mean values or regularly recurring spatial structures. Bias can also be detected by monitoring statistics of observed-minus-background residuals for different instruments. Bias-aware assimilation methods are designed to estimate and correct systematic errors jointly with the model state variables. Such methods require attribution of a bias to a particular source, and its characterization in terms of some well-defined set of parameters. They can be formulated either in a variational or sequential estimation framework by augmenting the system state with the bias parameters.

abstract = {Studies seeking to understand the impacts of climate variability and change on the hydrology of a region need to take into account the dynamics of vegetation and its interaction with the hydrologic and energy cycles. Yet, most of the hydrologic models used for these kinds of studies assume that vegetation is static. This paper presents a dynamic, spatially explicit model that couples a vertical energy balance scheme (surface and canopy layer) to a hydrologic model and a forest growth component to capture the dynamic interactions between energy, vegetation, and hydrology at hourly to daily time scales. The model is designed to be forced with outputs from regional climate models. Lateral water transfers are simulated using a 1D kinematic wave model. Infiltration is simulated using the Green and Ampt approximation to Richard's equation. The dynamics of soil moisture and energy drives carbon assimilation and forest growth, which in turn affect the distribution of energy and water through leaf dynamics by altering light interception, shading, and enhanced transpiration. The model is demonstrated in two case studies simulating energy, water, and vegetation dynamics at two different spatial and temporal scales. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

abstract = {Throughout history much of the world has witnessed ever-greater demands for reliable, high-quality and inexpensive water supplies for domestic consumption, agriculture and industry. In recent decades there have also been increasing demands for hydrological regimes that support healthy and diverse ecosystems, provide for water-based recreational activities, reduce if not prevent floods and droughts, and in some cases, provide for the production of hydropower and ensure water levels adequate for ship navigation. Water managers are challenged to meet these multiple and often conflicting demands. At the same time, public stakeholder interest groups have shown an increasing desire to take part in the water resources development and management decision making process. Added to all these management challenges are the uncertainties of natural water supplies and demands due to changes in our climate, changes in people's standards of living, changes in watershed land uses and changes in technology. How can managers develop, or redevelop and restore, and then manage water resources systems - systems ranging from small watersheds to those encompassing large river basins and coastal zones - in a way that meets society's changing objectives and goals? In other words, how can water resources systems become more integrated and sustainable?},

abstract = {Water fluxes in catchments are controlled by physical processes and material properties that are complex, heterogeneous, and poorly characterized by direct measurement. As a result, parsimonious theories of catchment hydrology remain elusive. Here I describe how one class of catchments (those in which discharge is determined by the volume of water in storage) can be characterized as simple first-order nonlinear dynamical systems, and I show that the form of their governing equations can be inferred directly from measurements of streamflow fluctuations. I illustrate this approach using data from the headwaters of the Severn and Wye rivers at Plynlimon in mid-Wales. This approach leads to quantitative estimates of catchment dynamic storage, recession time scales, and sensitivity to antecedent moisture, suggesting that it is useful for catchment characterization. It also yields a first-order nonlinear differential equation that can be used to directly simulate the streamflow hydrograph from precipitation and evapotranspiration time series. This single-equation rainfall-runoff model predicts streamflow at Plynlimon as accurately as other models that are much more highly parameterized. It can also be analytically inverted; thus, it can be used to {\&}{\#}8220;do hydrology backward,{\&}{\#}8221; that is, to infer time series of whole-catchment precipitation directly from fluctuations in streamflow. At Plynlimon, precipitation rates inferred from streamflow fluctuations agree with rain gauge measurements as closely as two rain gauges in each catchment agree with each other. These inferred precipitation rates are not calibrated to precipitation measurements in any way, making them a strong test of the underlying theory. The same approach can be used to estimate whole-catchment evapotranspiration rates during rainless periods. At Plynlimon, evapotranspiration rates inferred from streamflow fluctuations exhibit seasonal and diurnal cycles that agree semiquantitatively with Penman-Monteith estimates. Thus, streamflow hydrographs may be useful for reconstructing precipitation and evapotranspiration records where direct measurements are unavailable, unreliable, or unrepresentative at the scale of the landscape.},

To investigate the CANVEG model framework under such conditions, CO2, H2O, and sensible heat fluxes were measured with eddy-covariance methods together with xylem sap flux and leaf-level gas exchange in a 16-year-old (in 1999) southeastern loblolly pine forest. Leaf-level gas exchange measurements, collected over a 3-year period, provided all the necessary biochemical and physiological parameters for the CANVEG model. Using temperature-induced reductions of the biochemical kinetic rate constants, the CANVEG approach closely captures the diurnal patterns of the CO2 and H2O fluxes for two different formulations of the maximum Rubisco catalytic capacity (Vc max) - temperature function, suggesting that the CANVEG approach is not sensitive to Vc max variations for low temperatures. A soil moisture correction (wr ) to the Ball-Berry leaf-conductance approach was also proposed and tested. The wr magnitude is consistent with values predicted by a root-xylem hydraulic approach and with leaf-level measurements. The wr correction significantly improves the model's ability to capture diurnal patterns of H2O fluxes for drought conditions. The modeled bulk canopy conductance (Gm ) for pine foliage estimated from the CANVEG-modeled multilevel resistance values agreed well with canopy conductance (Gc ) independently estimated from pine sap flux measurements. Detailed sensitivity analysis suggests that the leaf-level physiological parameters used in CANVEG are not static.

The CANVEG model also reproduced basic biochemical processes as demonstrated by the agreement between modeled and leaf-level measured Ci /Ca , where Ci and Ca are the intercellular and atmospheric CO2 concentration, respectively. The model estimated that vapor pressure deficit does not vary significantly within the canopy but that Ci /C a varied by more than 15{\%}.

abstract = {Hydraulic connectivity on hillslopes and the existence of preferred soil moisture states in a catchment have important controls on runoff generation. In this study we investigate the relationships between soil moisture patterns, lateral hillslope flow, and streamflow generation in a semi-arid, snowmelt-driven catchment. We identify five soil moisture conditions that occur during a year and present a conceptual model based on field studies and computer simulations of how streamflow is generated with respect to the soil moisture conditions. The five soil moisture conditions are (1) a summer dry period, (2) a transitional fall wetting period, (3) a winter wet, low-flux period, (4) a spring wet, high-flux period, and (5) a transitional late-spring drying period. Transitions between the periods are driven by changes in the water balance between rain, snow, snowmelt and evapotranspiration. Low rates of water input to the soil during the winter allow dry soil regions to persist at the soil–bedrock interface, which act as barriers to lateral flow. Once the dry-soil flow barriers are wetted, whole-slope hydraulic connectivity is established, lateral flow can occur, and upland soils are in direct connection with the near-stream soil moisture. This whole-slope connectivity can alter near-stream hydraulics and modify the delivery of water, pressure, and solutes to the stream. Copyright},

abstract = {Hydrographs were recorded at three discharge stations at a small alluvial
stream during the summers of 1997 and 1998. A method of analysis
was set up so that the temporal variations in discharge resulting
from natural hydrological processes can be distinguished from the
influence from ground water being periodically abstracted approximately
60 m from the stream. Thus, evapotranspiration from the riparian
zone resulted in diurnal variations in streamflow with maximum amplitude
of 3-5 l/s, whereas heavy rainfall resulted in intense short-term
surface/subsurface flow from the riparian zone. The magnitude of
peak-flow was of the order of 2-3 times baseflow and such events
typically disturbed the hydrograph for one to three days. Baseflow
increased from about 35 l/s to about 70 l/s over the studied
reach, but when ground water was abstracted at rates of about 15 l/s
this resulted in a reduction in discharge. Within 4-8 days the reduction
stabilized at about 4 l/s and at 5-7 l/s, respectively,
at discharge stations 140 and 350 m downstream of the well site.
Predictions made by the analytical depletion model by [Ground Water,
37 (1999) 98] using the values of transmissivity and conductance
of the streambed estimated by [Ground Water, 40 (2002) 437] by drawdown
analysis compare reasonably well to the observed reduction of streamflow.},

abstract = {We evaluated the response of the Earth land biomes to drought by correlating a drought index with three global indicators of vegetation activity and growth: vegetation indices from satellite imagery, tree-ring growth series, and Aboveground Net Primary Production (ANPP) records. Arid and humid biomes are both affected by drought, and we suggest that the persistence of the water deficit (i.e., the drought time-scale) could be playing a key role in determining the sensitivity of land biomes to drought. We found that arid biomes respond to drought at short time-scales; that is, there is a rapid vegetation reaction as soon as water deficits below normal conditions occur. This may be due to the fact that plant species of arid regions have mechanisms allowing them to rapidly adapt to changing water availability. Humid biomes also respond to drought at short time-scales, but in this case the physiological mechanisms likely differ from those operating in arid biomes, as plants usually have a poor adaptability to water shortage. On the contrary, semiarid and subhumid biomes respond to drought at long time-scales, probably because plants are able to withstand water deficits, but they lack the rapid response of arid biomes to drought. These results are consistent among three vegetation parameters analyzed and across different land biomes, showing that the response of vegetation to drought depends on characteristic drought time-scales for each biome. Understanding the dominant time-scales at which drought most influences vegetation might help assessing the resistance and resilience of vegetation and improving our knowledge of vegetation vulnerability to climate change.},

abstract = {Severe droughts have been associated with regional-scale forest mortality worldwide. Climate change is expected to exacerbate regional mortality events; however, prediction remains difficult because the physiological mechanisms underlying drought survival and mortality are poorly understood. We developed a hydraulically based theory considering carbon balance and insect resistance that allowed development and examination of hypotheses regarding survival and mortality. Multiple mechanisms may cause mortality during drought. A common mechanism for plants with isohydric regulation of water status results from avoidance of drought-induced hydraulic failure via stomatal closure, resulting in carbon starvation and a cascade of downstream effects such as reduced resistance to biotic agents. Mortality by hydraulic failure per se may occur for isohydric seedlings or trees near their maximum height. Although anisohydric plants are relatively drought-tolerant, they are predisposed to hydraulic failure because they operate with narrower hydraulic safety margins during drought. Elevated temperatures should exacerbate carbon starvation and hydraulic failure. Biotic agents may amplify and be amplified by drought-induced plant stress. Wet multidecadal climate oscillations may increase plant susceptibility to drought-induced mortality by stimulating shifts in hydraulic architecture, effectively predisposing plants to water stress. Climate warming and increased frequency of extreme events will probably cause increased regional mortality episodes. Isohydric and anisohydric water potential regulation may partition species between survival and mortality, and, as such, incorporating this hydraulic framework may be effective for modeling plant survival and mortality under future climate conditions.},

abstract = {Three small catchments ({\textless}2.5 km(2) in size) were monitored in the Central Spanish Pyrenees to analyse the hydrological and geomorphological consequences of different land covers under the same climate scenario: (i) the San Salvador catchment represents a dense, undisturbed forest environment; (ii) the Arnas catchment corresponds to an old, abandoned cultivated area subjected to colonisation by plants; and (iii) the Araguas catchment consists in part of active badlands. The obtained results demonstrate that plant cover is a key factor, influencing (i) the seasonality and intensity of floods, (ii) the annual volume of discharge, and (iii) the suspended sediment concentration, total sediment yield and proportions of different types of sediment. The forested catchment tends to generate floods in late winter and spring, when the water table is close to the surface, and flood hydrographs are generally gentle, with solutes largely prevailing over suspended sediment. The old agricultural catchment produces in average twice the number of floods as that recorded in the forested catchment, with the highest floods recorded in autumn and spring; this catchment behaves as a complex mosaic, with a large spatial and temporal variability in terms of both sediment- and runoff-contributing areas; in addition, suspended sediment is equal to solutes, and bedload reaches a relatively high importance. Finally, the badland catchment reacts to all rainstorm events throughout the year, with a high suspended - sediment toad. Sediment outputs from the Araguas catchment are two orders of magnitude higher than in the Arnas and San Salvador catchments. Suspended sediment concentrations exceed 300 g l(-1) in the Araguas catchment, whereas they rarely exceed 20 g l(-1) in the ArnAs and rarely 1.5 g l(-1) in the San Salvador catchment.

abstract = {We investigate the effect of crop price and climate variables on rainfed corn and soybean yields and acreage in the United States using a large panel dataset for the 1977–2007 period. Instrumen-tal variables are used to control for endogeneity of prices in yield and acreage regressions, while allowing for spatially auto-correlated errors. We find that an increase in corn price has a statisti-cally significant positive impact on corn yield, but the effect of soybean price on soybean yields is not statistically significant. The estimated price elasticities of corn yield and acreage are 0.23 and 0.45, respectively. Of the increase in corn supply caused by an increase in corn price, we find that 33.8{\%} is due to price-induced yield enhancement and 66.2{\%} is due to price-induced acreage expansion. We also find that the impact of climate change on corn production ranges from −7{\%} to −41{\%} and on soybean ranges from −8{\%} to −45{\%}, depending on the climate change scenarios, time horizon, and global climate models used to predict climate change. We show that the aggre-gate net impact of omitting price variables is an overestimation of the effect of climate change on corn yield by up to 9{\%} and on soybean yield by up to 15{\%}.},

@article{Cappelaere2003,
abstract = {The drought in the African Sahel, persisting since 1968, emphasizes
the vulnerability of local water resources to climatic variations
and land use changes in this semiarid environment. Following the
Hapex-Sahel experiment (1992-1994), research aims at understanding
and modeling the impact on the hydrological cycle of these changing
climatic and environmental conditions over a 1500-km2 area east of
Niamey, Niger. The hydrological landscape consists of a myriad of
small endoreic catchments feeding temporary or permanent pools from
which water percolates to an unconfined aquifer. As the first step
in a local-to-regional scale approach to the water resource recharge
in the area, a physically based rainfall-runoff model is developed
for a typical, 1.9-km2 endoreic system named Wankama, which is monitored
continuously since 1992. This first of two companion papers describes
the key elements of the hydrological landscape, the experimental
setup with which the Wankama catchment and pool are monitored, the
r.water.fea distributed hydrological model and its application to
the construction of the Wankama catchment model. Because of the difficulties
of long-term field experimentation in the region, not all observed
events can be considered equally well recorded; in particular, detection
of exogenous water inflow occurrences that may alter Wankama runoff
estimates is needed. The paper describes the careful, model-aided
data analysis performed in order to select the observation set with
which the model can most reliably be tuned and operated. In this
rainfall-runoff data analysis phase, the model is used prior to any
calibration. Model calibration and verification, including output
uncertainty, are the subject of the second paper [J. Hydrol. (2003)].
All steps of analysis and modeling were performed on the 1992-1998
data only, before the 1999-2000 data became available, and are tested
a posteriori against the latter.},

abstract = {Over the last 4 decades the use of blue water has received increasing attention in water resources research, but little attention has been paid to the quantification of green water in food production and food trade. In this paper, we estimate both the blue and green water components of consumptive water use (CWU) for a wide range of agricultural crops, including seven cereal crops, cassava, cotton, groundnuts, potatoes, pulses, rapeseed, soybeans, sugar beets, sugarcane, and sunflower, with a spatial resolution of 30 arc min on the land surface. The results show that the global CWU of these crops amounted to 3823 km3 a1 for the period 1998–2002. More than 80{\%} of this amount was from green water. Around 94{\%} of the world crop-related virtual water trade has its origin in green water, which generally constitutes a low-opportunity cost of green water as opposed to blue water. High levels of net virtual water import (NVWI) generally occur in countries with low CWU on a per capita basis, where a virtual water strategy is an attractive water management option to compensate for domestic water shortage for food production. NVWI is constrained by income; low-income countries generally have a low level of NVWI. Strengthening low-income countries economically will allow them to develop a virtual water strategy to mitigate malnutrition of their people.},

abstract = {This paper illustrates a method for efficiently performing multiparametric
sensitivity analyses of the reliability model of a given system.
These analyses are of great importance for the identification of
critical components in highly hazardous plants, such as the nuclear
or chemical ones, thus providing significant insights for their risk-based
design and management. The technique used to quantify the importance
of a component parameter with respect to the system model is based
on a classical decomposition of the variance. When the model of the
system is realistically complicated (e.g. by aging, stand-by, maintenance,
etc.), its analytical evaluation soon becomes impractical and one
is better off resorting to Monte Carlo simulation techniques which,
however, could be computationally burdensome. Therefore, since the
variance decomposition method requires a large number of system evaluations,
each one to be performed by Monte Carlo, the need arises for possibly
substituting the Monte Carlo simulation model with a fast, approximated,
algorithm. Here we investigate an approach which makes use of neural
networks appropriately trained on the results of a Monte Carlo system
reliability/availability evaluation to quickly provide with reasonable
approximation, the values of the quantities of interest for the sensitivity
analyses. The work was a joint effort between the Department of Nuclear
Engineering of the Polytechnic of Milan, Italy, and the Institute
for Systems, Informatics and Safety, Nuclear Safety Unit of the Joint
Research Centre in Ispra, Italy which sponsored the project.},

abstract = {Similarities between the crop coefficient curve and a vegetation index showed potential for modeling a vegetation index into a crop coefficient. Therefore, the possibility of directly estimating the crop coefficient from measured reflectance properties of a crop/soil scene was investigated. Reflected canopy radiation in the 0.63 to 0.69 micrometer and 0.76 to 0.90 micrometer band widths was measured normal to and two meters above corn (Zea mays), and the normalized difference (ND) vegetation index was computed. The seasonal ND curve was curvilinear and resembled the basal crop coefficient curve for corn. Leaf area index and canopy shading were 3.2 and 77.6{\%}, respectively, when the ND reached its maximum value. A linear transformation of the ND was developed by equating the ND at effective cover and for dry, bare soil at the experimental site to the basal crop coefficient at effective cover and for dry soil evaporation, respectively. This transformation produced a seasonal curve very similar to the basal crop coefficient curve and was named the basal spectral crop coefficient. Crop coefficients derived from spectral measurements are independent of the usual time base parameters, planting date and effective cover date, associated with traditional crop coefficients. These real-time crop coefficients facilitate irrigation scheduling on a field-to-field basis over a large region if fields can be observed spectrally, because planting and assumed effective cover dates are not required.

Results indicate South Asia and Southern Africa as two regions that, without sufficient adaptation measures, will likely suffer negative impacts on several crops that are important to large food-insecure human populations. We also find that uncertainties vary widely by crop, and therefore priorities will depend on the risk attitudes of investment institutions.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Author(s) 2014. Natural grasses in semiarid rangelands constitute an effective protection against soil erosion and degradation, are a source of natural food for livestock and play a critical role in the hydrologic cycle by contributing to the uptake and transpiration of water. However, natural pastures are threatened by land abandonment and the consequent encroachment of shrubs and trees as well as by changing climatic conditions. In spite of their ecological and economic importance, the spatiotemporal variations of pasture production at the decadal-century scales over whole watersheds are poorly known. We used a physically based, spatially distributed ecohydrologic model applied to a 99.5 ha semiarid watershed in western Spain to investigate the sensitivity of pasture production to climate variability. The ecohydrologic model was run using a 300-year-long synthetic daily climate data set generated using a stochastic weather generator. The data set reproduced the range of climatic variations observed under the current climate. Results indicated that variation of pasture production largely depended on factors that also determined the availability of soil moisture such as the temporal distribution of precipitation, topography, and tree canopy cover. The latter is negatively related with production, reflecting the importance of rainfall and light interception, as well as water consumption by trees. Valley bottoms and flat areas in the lower parts of the catchment are characterized by higher pasture production but more interannual variability. A quantitative assessment of the quality of the simulations showed that ecohydrologic models are a valuable tool to investigate long-term (century scale) water and energy fluxes, as well as vegetation dynamics, in semiarid rangelands.},

abstract = {Information on the depression storage capacity (DSC) of soil surfaces
is needed for modelling surface runoff and erosion. However, time-consuming
measurements of the soil surface microrelief in a two-dimensional
grid are necessary to obtain accurate estimates. Therefore, estimation
of DSC from roughness indices requiring fewer measurements is desirable.
In this study a new simple and physically based roughness index was
developed and tested. Thirty-two soil surface microreliefs were determined
in Danish erosion study plots on two sandy loam soil types, Humic
Acrosol and Haplic Luvisol according to the FAO soil classification.
The soil treatments were: cultivated up-and-down the slope (black
fallow), mouldboard ploughed up-and-down the slope, winter wheat
(Triticum aestivum L.) drilled up-and-down the slope and winter wheat
drilled across the slope. The slope was ca. 10{\%} for all plots. Data
were treated initially by removing the slope after which 20 artificial
slopes (1-20{\%}) were introduced producing 640 data sets. The DSC was
calculated for each data set and a number of roughness indices were
related to the calculated DSC. The best correlation to DSC was obtained
by the newly developed index, mean upslope depression, MUD (R2 = 0.86),
followed by the geostatistically based limiting elevation difference,
LD, and limiting slope, LS (R2 = 0.76), and some statistically
based parameters as standard deviation adjusted for oriented roughness
up-and-down the slope (R2 = 0.76), random roughness, RR
(R2 = 0.67), and standard deviation adjusted for oriented
roughness both up-and-down and across the slope (R2 = 0.62).
Furthermore, MUD appeared to give less biased estimates than other
indices, which overestimated small DSC-values and underestimated
larger DSC-values. Calculations showed that the MUD index required
relatively few measurements. MUD based on less than 200 surface elevation
readings gave a good prediction (R2 {\textgreater} 0.7) of DSC of tilled
soil surfaces.},

abstract = {Elevated forest mortality has been attributed to climate change-induced droughts, but pre-diction of spatial mortality patterns remains challenging. We evaluated whether introducing plant hydraulics and topographic convergence-induced soil moisture variation to land surface models (LSM) can help explain spatial patterns of mortality. A scheme predicting plant hydraulic safety loss from soil moisture was developed using field measurements and a plant physiology–hydraulics model, TREES. The scheme was upscaled to Populus tremuloides forests across Colorado, USA, using LSM-modeled and topography-mediated soil moisture, respectively. The spatial patterns of hydraulic safety loss were com-pared against aerial surveyed mortality. Incorporating hydraulic safety loss raised the explanatory power of mortality by 40{\%} com-pared to LSM-modeled soil moisture. Topographic convergence was mostly influential in sup-pressing mortality in low and concave areas, explaining an additional 10{\%} of the variations in mortality for those regions. Plant hydraulics integrated water stress along the soil–plant continuum and was more closely tied to plant physiological response to drought. In addition to the well-recognized topo-climate influence due to elevation and aspect, we found evidence that topographic con-vergence mediates tree mortality in certain parts of the landscape that are low and conver-gent, likely through influences on plant-available water.},

abstract = {The successful application of a conceptual rainfall-runoff (CRR) model depends on how well it is calibrated. Despite the popularity of CRR models, reports in the literature indicate that it is typically difficult, if not impossible, to obtain unique optimal values for their parameters using automatic calibration methods. Unless the best set of parameters associated with a given calibration data set can be found, it is difficult to determine how sensitive the parameter estimates (and hence the model forecasts) are to factors such as input and output data error, model error, quantity and quality of data, objective function used, and so on. Results are presented that establish clearly the nature of the multiple optima problem for the research CRR model SIXPAR. These results suggest that the CRR model optimization problem is more difficult than had been previously thought and that currently used local search procedures have a very low probability of successfully finding the optimal parameter sets. Next, the performance of three existing global search procedures are evaluated on the model SIXPAR. Finally, a powerful new global optimization procedure is presented, entitled the shuffled complex evolution (SCE-UA) method, which was able to consistently locate the global optimum of the SIXPAR model, and appears to be capable of efficiently and effectively solving the CRR model optimization problem.},

abstract = {In high-altitude alpine catchments, diurnal streamflow cycles are typically dominated by snowmelt or ice melt. Evapotranspiration-induced diurnal streamflow cycles are less observed in these catchments but might happen simultaneously. During a field campaign in the summer 2012 in an alpine catchment in the Swiss Alps (Val Ferret catchment, 20.4 km(2), glaciarized area: 2{\%}), we observed a transition in the early season from a snowmelt to an evapotranspiration-induced diurnal streamflow cycle in one of two monitored subbasins. The two different cycles were of comparable amplitudes and the transition happened within a time span of several days. In the second monitored subbasin, we observed an ice melt-dominated diurnal cycle during the entire season due to the presence of a small glacier. Comparisons between ice melt and evapotranspiration cycles showed that the two processes were happening at the same times of day but with a different sign and a different shape. The amplitude of the ice melt cycle decreased exponentially during the season and was larger than the amplitude of the evapotranspiration cycle which was relatively constant during the season. Our study suggests that an evapotranspiration-dominated diurnal streamflow cycle could damp the ice melt-dominated diurnal streamflow cycle. The two types of diurnal streamflow cycles were separated using a method based on the identification of the active riparian area and measurement of evapotranspiration.},

Instrumen-tal variables are used to control for endogeneity of prices in yield and acreage regressions, while allowing for spatially auto-correlated errors. We find that an increase in corn price has a statisti-cally significant positive impact on corn yield, but the effect of soybean price on soybean yields is not statistically significant. The estimated price elasticities of corn yield and acreage are 0.23 and 0.45, respectively. Of the increase in corn supply caused by an increase in corn price, we find that 33.8{\%} is due to price-induced yield enhancement and 66.2{\%} is due to price-induced acreage expansion. We also find that the impact of climate change on corn production ranges from −7{\%} to −41{\%} and on soybean ranges from −8{\%} to −45{\%}, depending on the climate change scenarios, time horizon, and global climate models used to predict climate change. We show that the aggre-gate net impact of omitting price variables is an overestimation of the effect of climate change on corn yield by up to 9{\%} and on soybean yield by up to 15{\%}.},

abstract = {Event-based hydrologic modeling is common practice for semiarid basins where runoff is restricted to short periods after a storm. Such models are used to predict runoff production and soil erosion in agricultural areas as well as the effects of storms on sewer systems, all in areas with limited information. Sometimes, model parameterization is done through infiltration experiments to obtain a parametric infiltration curve or using standard values in lookup tables associated with land use as it is often the case for hydraulic roughness. The model may then be used to predict soil losses or runoff production in storms of different intensities. In the present study a distributed hydrologic model was calibrated to see if rainfall-runoff events of different intensities in a single semiarid basin may have different optimal calibrated sets of parameters. To achieve this, 17 sequential events were calibrated covering a wide range of conditions and storm types in the semiarid southwest of Spain. Two parameters related to roughness (Manning's n and standard deviation of terrain micro-heights) and three related to infiltration (initial and final infiltration capacities and infiltration decay rate) were calibrated for each event. The results show that the calibrated set of parameters and their sensitivities change through time. The drift of the minima in the parameter space is partially explained by the type of storm. Hydraulic roughness and initial infiltration capacity showed the highest sensitivity to rainfall intensity, while steady state infiltration capacity showed sensitivity to information used as a proxy for the wetness state of the basin. The dynamics of the parameters and their relative sensitivities indicate that the model has to adjust itself to the different conditions of the basin so no single set of parameters characterizes the basin. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The quantitative importance of aerodynamic resistance to H(2)O vapor and CO(2) exchange was determined for shoots from saplings of three conifers (Abies lasiocarpa [Hook] Nutt., Pinus contorta Dougl., Juniperus communis L.) under natural conditions in the field. A combination of relatively low stomatal resistances ({\textless}300 seconds per centimeter) and low wind speeds ({\textless}30 centimeters per second) led to substantial contributions of the aerodynamic resistance (R(wv) (a)) to water use efficiency (WUE = photosynthesis/transpiration) for all three species. For A. lasiocarpa, transpiration was calculated to be 44{\%} less and photosynthesis 17{\%} less due to the presence of R(wv) (a), which led to a predicted increase in WUE of 57{\%} compared to the calculated WUE when R(wv) (a) was assumed negligible. Similar increases in WUE were computed for P. contorta (48{\%}) with somewhat smaller values for J. communis (34{\%}). These results are discussed in terms of the estimated importance of R(wv) (a) on water and photosynthetic relations of plants that have relatively low stomatal resistances and grow in microhabitats with low winds.},

abstract = {Surface soil moisture content exhibits a high degree of spatial and
temporal variability. The purpose of this study was (a) to characterize
variations in moisture content in the 0-5 cm surface soil layer
along a hillslope transect by means of intensive sampling in both
space and time; and (b) to make inferences regarding the environmental
factors that influence this variability. Over a period of seven months,
soil moisture content was measured (gravimetric method) on a near-daily
basis at 10 m intervals along a 200 m downslope transect
at the Rattlesnake Hill field site in Austin, Texas. Results indicate
that significant variability in soil moisture content exists along
the length of the transect; that variability decreases with decreasing
transect-mean moisture content as the hillslope dries down following
rain events; and that the dominant influences on moisture content
variability are dependent upon the moisture conditions on the hillslope.
While topographic and soil attributes operate jointly to redistribute
soil water following storm events, under wet conditions, variability
in surface moisture content is most strongly influenced by porosity
and hydraulic conductivity, and under dry conditions, correlations
are strongest to relative elevation, aspect and clay content. Consequently,
the dominant influence on soil moisture variability gradually changes
from soil heterogeneity to joint control by topographic and soil
properties as the transect dries following significant rain events.},

To address this need, this paper evaluates an LDAS for agricultural drought monitoring by benchmarking individual components of the system (i.e., a satellite soil moisture retrieval algorithm, a soil water balance model, and a sequential data assimilation filter) against a series of linear models that perform the same function (i.e., have the same basic input/output structure) as the full system component. Benchmarking is based on the calculation of the lagged rank cross correlation between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and soil moisture estimates acquired for various components of the system. Lagged soil moisture/NDVI correlations obtained using individual LDAS components versus their linear analo...},

@article{White2011,
abstract = {Ecophysiological models are widely used to forecast potential impacts of climate change on future agricultural productivity and to examine options for adaptation by local stakeholders and policy makers. However, protocols followed in such assessments vary to such an extent that they constrain cross-study syntheses and increase the potential for bias in projected impacts. We reviewed 221 peer-reviewed papers that used crop simulation models to examine diverse aspects of how climate change might affect agricultural systems. Six subject areas were examined: target crops and regions; the crop model(s) used and their characteristics; sources and application of data on [CO2] and climate; impact parameters evaluated; assessment of variability or risk; and adaptation strategies. Wheat, maize, soybean and rice were considered in approximately 170 papers. The USA (55 papers) and Europe (64 papers) were the dominant regions studied. The most frequent approach used to simulate response to CO2 involved adjusting daily radiation use efficiency (RUE) and transpiration, precluding consideration of the interacting effects of CO2, stomatal conductance and canopy temperature, which are expected to exacerbate effects of global warming. The assumed baseline [CO2] typically corresponded to conditions 10–30 years earlier than the date the paper was accepted, exaggerating the relative impacts of increased [CO2]. Due in part to the diverse scenarios for increases in greenhouse gas emissions, assumed future [CO2] also varied greatly, further complicating comparisons among studies. Papers considering adaptation predominantly examined changes in planting dates and cultivars; only 20 papers tested different tillage practices or crop rotations. Risk was quantified in over half the papers, mainly in relation to variability in yield or effects of water deficits, but the limited consideration of other factors affecting risk beside climate change per se suggests that impacts of climate change were overestimated relative to background variability. A coordinated crop, climate and soil data resource would allow researchers to focus on underlying science. More extensive model intercomparison, facilitated by modular software, should strengthen the biological realism of predictions and clarify the limits of our ability to forecast agricultural impacts of climate change on crop production and associated food security as well as to evaluate potential for adaptation.},

abstract = {Many remote sensing applications are devoted to the agricultural sector. Representative case studies are presented in the special issue “Advances in Remote Sensing of Agriculture”. To complement the examples published within the special issue, a few main applications with regional to global focus were selected for this review, where remote sensing contributions are traditionally strong. The selected applications are put in the context of the global challenges the agricultural sector is facing: minimizing the environmental impact, while increasing production and productivity. Five different applications have been selected, which are illustrated and described: (1) biomass and yield estimation, (2) vegetation vigor and drought stress monitoring, (3) assessment of crop phenological development, (4) crop acreage estimation and cropland mapping and (5) mapping of disturbances and land use/land cover (LULC) changes. Many other applications exist, such as precision agriculture and irrigation management (see other special issues of this journal), but were not included to keep the paper concise. The paper starts with an overview of the main agricultural challenges. This section is followed by a brief overview of existing operational monitoring systems. Finally, in the main part of the paper, the mentioned applications are described and illustrated. The review concludes with some key recommendations.},

abstract = {The article presents a reply by the authors to a commentary on their paper entitled The Impact of Global Warming on Agriculture: A Ricardian Approach, published in the September 1994 issue of the American Economic Review. In our paper we developed an approach to measuring the impact of global warming on agriculture. We call this approach Ricardian because it relies upon standard rent theory as a way of identifying the impact of changes on net economic welfare. We compared the Ricardian approach with the traditional production-function approach, which uses agricultural production functions but has great difficulty identifying all the other adjustments that farmers make in response to changing external conditions. The Ricardian approach is particularly well-suited to a tremendously heterogenous sector because it can rely upon reduced-form estimation and does not require the impossible task of constructing structural models of hundreds of crops in thousands of locations. Our Ricardian approach assumes that the existing pattern of agricultural land rents and land prices reflects the long-run equilibrium economic effect of climate and other geophysical and economic variables. Standard economic reasoning shows that, by calculating the estimated effects of perturbing the climatic variables, we can project the impact of climate change on economic welfare.},

abstract = {Research on the degree to which carbon (C) availability limits growth in trees, as well as recent trends in climate change and concurrent increases in drought-related tree mortality, have led to a renewed focus on the physiological mechanisms associated with tree growth responses to current and future climate. This has led to some dispute over the role of stored non-structural C compounds as indicators of a tree's current demands for photosynthate. Much of the uncertainty surrounding this issue could be resolved by developing a better understanding of the potential functions of non-structural C stored within trees. In addition to functioning as a buffer to reconcile temporal asynchrony between C demand and supply, the storage of non-structural C compounds may be under greater regulation than commonly recognized. We propose that in the face of environmental stochasticity, large, long-lived trees may require larger C investments in storage pools as safety margins than previously recognized, and that an important function of these pools may be to maintain hydraulic transport, particularly during episodes of severe stress. If so, survival and long-term growth in trees remain a function of C availability. Given that drought, freeze-thaw events and increasing tree height all impose additional constraints on vascular transport, the common trend of an increase in non-structural carbohydrate concentrations with tree size, drought or cold is consistent with our hypothesis. If the regulated maintenance of relatively large constitutive stored C pools in trees serves to maintain hydraulic integrity, then the minimum thresholds are expected to vary depending on the specific tissues, species, environment, growth form and habit. Much research is needed to elucidate the extent to which allocation of C to storage in trees is a passive vs. an active process, the specific functions of stored C pools, and the factors that drive active C allocation to storage.},

abstract = {A watershed can be simulated as a multiagent system (MAS) composed of spatially distributed land and water users (agents) within a common defined environment. The watershed system is characterized by distributed decision processes at the agent level with a coordination mechanism organizing the interactions among individual decision processes at the system level. This paper presents a decentralized (distributed) optimization method known as constraint-based reasoning, which allows individual agents in an MAS to optimize their behaviors over various alternatives. The method incorporates the optimization of all agents' objectives through an interaction scheme, in which the ith agent optimizes its objective with a selected priority for collaboration and forwards the solution and consequences to all agents that interact with it. Agents are allowed to determine how important their own objectives are in comparison with the constraints, using a local interest factor ($\beta$i). A large $\beta$i value indicates a selfish agent who puts high priority on its own benefit and ignores collaboration requirements. This bottom-up problem-solving approach mimics real-world watershed management problems better than conventional “top-down” optimization methods in which it is assumed that individual agents will completely comply with any recommendations that the coordinator makes. The method is applied to a steady state hypothetical watershed with three off-stream human agents, one in-stream human agent (reservoir), and two ecological agents.},

abstract = {The influence of climate variation on the availability of water resources was analyzed in the headwaters of the Tagus River basin using two drought indices, the standardized precipitation index (SPI) and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). This basin is highly regulated and strategic, and contains two hyperannual reservoirs that are the origin of the water supply system for Mediterranean areas of southeast Spain. The indices confirmed that drought conditions have prevailed in the headwaters of the Tagus River since the 1970s. The responses in river discharge and reservoir storage were slightly higher when based on the SPEI rather than the SPI, which indicates that although precipitation had a major role in explaining temporal variability in the analyzed parameters, the influence of temperature was not negligible. Moreover, the greatest response in hydrological variables was evident over longer timescales of the climatic drought indices. Although the effect of climate variability on water resources was substantial during the analyzed period, we also showed a major change in hydrological-climatic relationships in regulated systems including reservoir storage and outflow. These were closely related to changes in external demand following commencement of the water transfer system to the J{\'{u}}car and Segura basins after the 1980s. The marked reduction in water availability in the basin, which is related to more frequent droughts, contrasts with the amount of water transferred, which shows a clear upward trend associated with increasing water demand in the Mediterranean basin. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

for forested watersheds in the area. The detailed soil spatial information
strongly impacted the simulation of net photosynthesis over the period
when there is a moisture stress, but negligible impacts when there
is sufficient water recharge to soil profiles. Simulation of hydro-ecological
responses using a distributed parameter approach is less impacted

also only occurred during the period of moisture stress. The impacts
on spatial distribution of simulated transpiration occurred mainly

abstract = {A frequently encountered difficulty in assessing model-predicted land–atmosphere exchanges of moisture and energy is the absence of comprehensive observations to which model predictions can be compared at the spatial and temporal resolutions at which the models operate. Various methods have been used to evaluate the land surface schemes in coupled models, including comparisons of model-predicted evapotranspiration with values derived from atmospheric water balances, comparison of model-predicted energy and radiative fluxes with tower measurements during periods of intensive observations, comparison of model-predicted runoff with observed streamflow, and comparison of model predictions of soil moisture with spatial averages of point observations. While these approaches have provided useful model diagnostic information, the observation-based products used in the comparisons typically are inconsistent with the model variables with which they are compared—for example, observations are for points or areas much smaller than the model spatial resolution, comparisons are restricted to temporal averages, or the spatial scale is large compared to that resolved by the model. Furthermore, none of the datasets available at present allow an evaluation of the interaction of the water balance components over large regions for long periods. In this study, a model-derived dataset of land surface states and fluxes is presented for the conterminous United States and portions of Canada and Mexico. The dataset spans the period 1950–2000, and is at a 3-h time step with a spatial resolution of ⅛ degree. The data are distinct from reanalysis products in that precipitation is a gridded product derived directly from observations, and both the land surface water and energy budgets balance at every time step. The surface forcings include precipitation and air tem- perature (both gridded from observations), and derived downward solar and longwave radiation, vapor pressure deficit, and wind. Simulated runoff is shown to match observations quite well over large river basins. On this basis, and given the physically based model parameterizations, it is argued that other terms in the surface water balance (e.g., soil moisture and evapotranspiration) are well represented, at least for the purposes of diagnostic studies such as those in which atmospheric model reanalysis products have been widely used. These characteristics make this dataset useful for a variety of studies, especially where ground observations are lacking.},

abstract = {The diurnal cycle in streamflow constitutes a significant part of the variability in many rivers in the western United States and can be used to understand some of the dominant processes affecting the water balance of a given river basin. Rivers in which water is added diurnally, as in snowmelt, and rivers in which water is removed diurnally, as in evapotranspiration and infiltration, exhibit substantial differences in the timing, relative magnitude, and shape of their diurnal flow variations. Snowmelt-dominated rivers achieve their highest sustained flow and largest diurnal fluctuations during the spring melt season. These fluctuations are characterized by sharp rises and gradual declines in discharge each day. In large snowmelt-dominated basins, at the end of the melt season, the hour of maximum discharge shifts to later in the day as the snow line retreats to higher elevations. Many evapotranspiration/infiltration-dominated rivers in the western states achieve their highest sustained flows dur...},

abstract = {The land surface phenology (LSP) start of season (SOS) metric signals the seasonal onset of vegetation activity, including canopy growth and associated increases in land-atmosphere water, energy and carbon (CO2) exchanges influencing weather and climate variability. The vegetation optical depth (VOD) parameter determined from satellite passive microwave remote sensing provides for global LSP monitoring that is sensitive to changes in vegetation canopy water content and biomass, and insensitive to atmosphere and solar illumination constraints. Direct field measures of canopy water content and biomass changes desired for LSP validation are generally lacking due to the prohibitive costs of maintaining regional monitoring networks. Alternatively, a normalized microwave reflectance index (NMRI) derived from GPS base station measurements is sensitive to daily vegetation water content changes and may provide for effective microwave LSP validation. We compared multiyear (2007-2011) NMRI and satellite VOD records at over 300 GPS sites in North America, and their derived SOS metrics for a subset of 24 homogenous land cover sites to investigate VOD and NMRI correspondence, and potential NMRI utility for LSP validation. Significant correlations (P {\textless} 0.05) were found at 276 of 305 sites (90.5 {\%}), with generally favorable correspondence in the resulting SOS metrics (r (2) = 0.73, P {\textless} 0.001, RMSE = 36.8 days). This study is the first attempt to compare satellite microwave LSP metrics to a GPS network derived reflectance index and highlights both the utility and limitations of the NMRI data for LSP validation, including spatial scale discrepancies between local NMRI measurements and relatively coarse satellite VOD retrievals.},

abstract = {Research on the degree to which carbon (C) availability limits growth in trees, as well as recent trends in climate change and concurrent increases in drought-related tree mortality, have led to a renewed focus on the physiological mechanisms associated with tree growth responses to current and future climate. This has led to some dispute over the role of stored non-structural C compounds as indicators of a tree's current demands for photosynthate. Much of the uncertainty surrounding this issue could be resolved by developing a better understanding of the potential functions of non-structural C stored within trees. In addition to functioning as a buffer to reconcile temporal asynchrony between C demand and supply, the storage of non-structural C compounds may be under greater regulation than commonly recognized. We propose that in the face of environmental stochasticity, large, long-lived trees may require larger C investments in storage pools as safety margins than previously recognized, and that an important function of these pools may be to maintain hydraulic transport, particularly during episodes of severe stress. If so, survival and long-term growth in trees remain a function of C availability. Given that drought, freeze-thaw events and increasing tree height all impose additional constraints on vascular transport, the common trend of an increase in non-structural carbohydrate concentrations with tree size, drought or cold is consistent with our hypothesis. If the regulated maintenance of relatively large constitutive stored C pools in trees serves to maintain hydraulic integrity, then the minimum thresholds are expected to vary depending on the specific tissues, species, environment, growth form and habit. Much research is needed to elucidate the extent to which allocation of C to storage in trees is a passive vs. an active process, the specific functions of stored C pools, and the factors that drive active C allocation to storage.},

abstract = {Snowmelt is the most important hydrological event in cold climates. However, snowmelt effects on suspended sediment (SS) and phosphorus (P) loss are poorly documented in Canada. Using two agricultural watersheds in Eastern Canada, this study aimed to quantify SS and P loss during the snowmelt period and to investigate how snowmelt contributes SS and P loss. Water samples were collected from the outlets of the Bras d'Henri watershed (BHW, 2007-2009) and Black Brook watershed (BBW, 2008-2009) and measured for SS and P concentrations. Hydrological parameters (precipitation, snow water equivalent, and runoff discharge), soil frozen status and soil temperature were also measured. Results revealed interannual variation of snowmelt conditions and SS and P losses in each watershed. The 2008 snowmelt in BHW and BBW mainly occurred on unfrozen soils, while the 2007 and 2009 snowmelts in BHW and 2009 snowmelt in BBW mainly on frozen soils. In BHW, 2008 snowmelt caused much higher median concentrations of SS, total P (TP), dissolved P (DP) and particulate P (PP) in stream water than 2007 and 2009; ratios of PP fractions in TP were variable with events but the median values were similar, suggesting both DP and PP important contrubutors to TP loss. In BBW, the median concentration of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) in stream water was greater in 2008 snowmelt than in 2009 snowmelt; PP dominated TP loss. This study also suggests that soil state (i.e. frozen status) and rainfall were the most important factors influencing SS and P losses during snowmelt. Furthermore, snowmelt P export represented more than 20{\%} of the total annual P export in BHW, and more than 12{\%} of the annual DRP export in BBW. Thus, we strongly recommend adopting Best Management Practices (BMPs) that specifically target sediment and P loss during snowmelt. Crown Copyright (c) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

data given independent retention data can be treated by an extension
to a Bayesian estimator. As an example, we apply the methodology
to retention and transient unsaturated outflow observations, both
obtained on the same medium sand sample. We found the van Genuchten
expression to be adequate for the retention data, as the best fit
was within measurement error. The Cramer-Rao confidence bound described
the true parameter uncertainty approximately. The Mualem-van Genuchten
expression was, however, inadequate for our outflow observations,
suggesting that the parameters ([alpha], n) may not always be equivalent

abstract = {Quantifying water balance components, which is particularly challenging
in snow-fed, semi-arid regions, is crucial to understanding the basic
hydrology of a watershed. In this study, a water balance was computed
using 10 years of data collected at the Upper Sheep Creek Watershed,
a 26-ha semi-arid mountainous sub-basin within the Reynolds Creek
Experimental Watershed in southwest Idaho, USA. The approach computed
a partial water balance for each of three landscape units and then
computed an aggregated water balance for the watershed. Runoff and
change in ground water storage were not distinguishable between landscape
units. Precipitation, which occurs predominantly as snow, was measured
within each landscape unit directly and adjusted for drifting. Spatial
variability of effective precipitation was shown to be greater during
years with higher precipitation. Evapotranspiration, which accounted
for nearly 90{\%} of the effective precipitation, was estimated using
the Simultaneous Heat and Water (SHAW) Model and validated with measurements
from Bowen ratio instruments. Runoff from the watershed was correlated
to precipitation above a critical threshold of approximately 450 mm
of precipitation necessary to generate runoff (r2=0.52). The average
water balance error was 46 mm, or approximately 10{\%} of the estimated
effective precipitation for the ten-year period. The error was largely
attributed to deep percolation losses through fractures in the basalt
underlying the watershed. Simulated percolation of the water beyond
the root zone correlated extremely well with measured runoff (r2=0.90),
which is derived almost entirely from subsurface flow. Above a threshold
of 50 mm, approximately 67{\%} of the water percolating beyond
the root zone produces runoff. The remainder was assumed to be lost
to deep percolation through the basalt. This can have important ramifications
in addressing subsurface flow and losses when applying a snowmelt
runoff model to simulate runoff and hydrologic processes in the watershed.},

abstract = {The ecological consequences of habitat fragmentation include the direct effects of habitat loss and the indirect effects of reduced inter-patch dispersal. In particular, habitat patches that survive the process of fragmentation become increasingly isolated from one another, and this can cause species' declines in excess of predictions based strictly on reductions in habitat area. To quantify the hindrance of-dispersal caused by habitat fragmentation, landscape ecologists have invented the notion of habitat connectivity. Indices of landscape pattern are frequently used to estimate habitat connectivity, but whether they actually do so remains undocumented. If indices of habitat pattern do indeed estimate habitat connectivity, then these indices should correlate well with predictions of dispersal success. To test this possibility, I looked for correlations between nine common indices of habitat pattern and the results of a simulated dispersal process conducted using GIS data on the distribution of old-growth forest through the Pacific Northwest. The nine indices of habitat pattern that I examined were only weakly correlated with the results from the dispersal modeling, but I identified a new pattern index, termed patch cohesion, for which the fit was much better. Moreover, I found patch cohesion to be insensitive to the details and artifacts of the dispersal model. The methodology described here will be useful to investigators using indices of-landscape pattern to quantify habitat fragmentation.},

abstract = {Concern exists about future changes to air-temperature gradients along large "northward"-flowing Arctic rivers having the potential to affect the timing and severity of spring river-ice breakup, and associated flooding events. To evaluate the significance of this concern, an analysis was conducted of temporal and spatial changes to the spring 0 degrees C air-temperature isotherm (I-0 degrees C), which is also known to be a good index for the timing of spring melt/breakup conditions. Changes in I-0 degrees C were analyzed for the downstream 2000-km main-stem reaches of four large Arctic rivers: the Lena, Mackenzie, Ob and Yenisey. Current climatic conditions (1979-2008) were compared to those of two future climatic periods (2041-2070 and 20712100) projected by an ensemble of four Global Climate Models. Future projections show I-0 degrees C chronology patterns along the rivers that closely parallel current conditions, but with earlier dates varying from an ensemble mean of 7.5 (13.6) to 16.5 (25.5) days for the 2050s (2080s). Results also reveal a progressive downstream increase in warming under future climates. At the time when headwater temperatures reach 0 degrees C, river mouth to headwater temperature differences for the four rivers decrease by an average of 0.8 degrees C (2.4 degrees C) to 2.1 degrees C (3.7 degrees C) for the 2050s (2080s).

@article{Landerer2012,
abstract = {We assess the accuracy of global-gridded terrestrial water storage (TWS) estimates derived from temporal gravity field variations observed by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites. The TWS data set has been corrected for signal modification due to filtering and truncation. Simulations of terrestrial water storage variations from land-hydrology models are used to infer relationships between regional time series representing different spatial scales. These relationships, which are independent of the actual GRACE data, are used to extrapolate the GRACE TWS estimates from their effective spatial resolution (length scales of a few hundred kilometers) to finer spatial scales (∼100 km). Gridded, scaled data like these enable users who lack expertise in processing and filtering the standard GRACE spherical harmonic geopotential coefficients to estimate the time series of TWS over arbitrarily shaped regions. In addition, we provide gridded fields of leakage and GRACE measurement errors that allow users to rigorously estimate the associated regional TWS uncertainties. These fields are available for download from the GRACE project website (available at http://grace.jpl.nasa.gov). Three scaling relationships are examined: a single gain factor based on regionally averaged time series, spatially distributed (i.e., gridded) gain factors based on time series at each grid point, and gridded-gain factors estimated as a function of temporal frequency. While regional gain factors have typically been used in previously published studies, we find that comparable accuracies can be obtained from scaled time series based on gridded gain factors. In regions where different temporal modes of TWS variability have significantly different spatial scales, gain factors based on the first two methods may reduce the accuracy of the scaled time series. In these cases, gain factors estimated separately as a function of frequency may be necessary to achieve accurate results. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2012 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {The ultimate proof of our understanding of natural or technological systems is reflected in our ability to control them. Although control theory offers mathematical tools for steering engineered and natural systems towards a desired state, a framework to control complex self-organized systems is lacking. Here we develop analytical tools to study the controllability of an arbitrary complex directed network, identifying the set of driver nodes with time-dependent control that can guide the system's entire dynamics. We apply these tools to several real networks, finding that the number of driver nodes is determined mainly by the network's degree distribution. We show that sparse inhomogeneous networks, which emerge in many real complex systems, are the most difficult to control, but that dense and homogeneous networks can be controlled using a few driver nodes. Counterintuitively, we find that in both model and real systems the driver nodes tend to avoid the high-degree nodes.},

We formally derive the necessary and sufficient conditions under which the model can replicate a reference allocation while displaying crop supply responses consistent with exogenous information on supply elasticities. When it exists, the solution to the exact calibration problem is unique. Subject to a caveat, the proposed specification is shown to be more flexible with respect to calibration than the quadratic specification that has been used extensively in policy models based on positive mathematical programming.},

abstract = {The Saint-Venant equations are used to describe river waves. Generally,
for flood routing in rivers, the Saint-Venant system is reduced to
the diffusive wave equation which can be resolved using finite-difference
algorithms. The choice of a numerical method, and of the space and
time steps to be retained, depends essentially on the form of flood
hydrographs and the hydraulic properties of the river. This paper
investigates these areas; two sets of criteria are propossed, the
first to define parameter ranges representing each wave type and
then, in the particular case of the diffusive wave model, to define
criteria for the choice of numerical algorithm and appropriate space
and time steps. The first analysis was based on the concept that
river wave behaviour is determined by the balance between friction
and inertia. The conclusions relate to the magnitude of temporal
characteristics of flood waves, expressed as a function of the Froude
number of the steady uniform flow and a dimensionless wave number
of the unsteady component of the motion. The second part discussed
questions related to the diffusive wave problem and to numerical
instabilities. A technique is proposed to guide the user in the choice
of the computational algorithm and specifies the error introduced
by numerical methods. The technique was applied to flood-routing
simulation for the Loire river in France. In this case, two finite-difference
algorithms were compared to the exact solution given by the analytical
method. Comparisons between results show the efficiency of the technique
to optimise the choice of the finite-difference method and the adequate
space and time steps.},

hydrograph. Comparing these four methods indicates that LHS produces
analytical results similar to those of MCS. According to our results,
the LHS only needs 10{\%} of the number of MCS parameters to achieve
similar performance. However, the analysis results from RPEM and

abstract = {The ability to regionally monitor crop progress and condition through the growing season benefits both crop management and yield estimation. In the United States, these metrics are reported weekly at state or district (multiple counties) levels by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) using field observations provided by trained local reporters. However, the ground data collection process supporting this effort is time consuming and subjective. Furthermore, operational crop management and yield estimation efforts require information with more granularity than at the state or district level. This paper evaluates remote sensing approaches for mapping crop phenology using vegetation index time-series generated by fusing Landsat and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) surface reflectance imagery to improve temporal sampling over that provided by Landsat alone. The case study focuses on an agricultural region in central Iowa from 2001 to 2014. Our objectives are 1) to assess Landsat-MODIS data fusion results over cropland; 2) to map crop phenology at 30 m resolution using fused surface reflectance data; and 3) to identify the relationships between remotely sensed crop phenology metrics and the crop progress stages reported by NASS. The results show that detailed spatial and temporal variability in vegetation development across this landscape can be identified using the fused Landsat-MODIS data. The mean difference (bias) in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) between actual Landsat observations and the fused Landsat-MODIS data, generated for Landsat overpass dates, is in the range of − 0.011 to 0.028 for every year. The derived phenological metrics show distinct features for different crops and natural vegetation at field scales. Strong correlations are observed between remotely sensed phenological stages, based on NDVI curve inflection points, and the observed crop physiological growth stages from the NASS Crop Progress (CP) reports. The green-up dates detected from remote sensing data typically occurred during crop vegetative stages when 2–4 leaves were developed for both corn and soybeans, or about 1–3 weeks after the reported emergence dates when the plant were first visible to ground-based observers. Despite being a lagging indicator, remotely sensed green-up can be used effectively to backcast emergence, e.g. as input to spatially distributed crop models. The differences in green-up date between corn and soybean were 8–10 days, consistent with the offset in emergence dates reported by NASS at district level. The reported harvest dates were typically about 2–3 weeks after the dormancy stage was detected via remote sensing for corn and about 1–2 weeks for soybeans. This suggests that probable harvest times for individual fields may be predicted 1–3 weeks ahead using remote sensing data. The results suggest that crop phenology and certain growth stages at field scales (30 m spatial resolution) can be linked and mapped by integrating imagery from multiple remote sensing platforms.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 by the authors. Accurate crop yield assessments using satellite remote sensing-based methods are of interest for regional monitoring and the design of policies that promote agricultural resiliency and food security. However, the application of current vegetation productivity algorithms derived from global satellite observations is generally too coarse to capture cropland heterogeneity. The fusion of data from different sensors can provide enhanced information and overcome many of the limitations of individual sensors. In thitables study, we estimate annual crop yields for seven important crop types across Montana in the continental USA from 2008-2015, including alfalfa, barley, maize, peas, durum wheat, spring wheat and winter wheat. We used a satellite data-driven light use efficiency (LUE) model to estimate gross primary productivity (GPP) over croplands at 30-m spatial resolution and eight-day time steps using a fused NDVI dataset constructed by blending Landsat (5 or 7) and Terra MODIS reflectance data. The fused 30-m NDVI record showed good consistency with the original Landsat and MODIS data, but provides better spatiotemporal delineations of cropland vegetation growth. Crop yields were estimated at 30-m resolution as the product of estimated GPP accumulated over the growing season and a crop-specific harvest index (HIGPP). The resulting GPP estimates capture characteristic cropland productivity patterns and seasonal variations, while the estimated annual crop production results correspond favorably with reported county-level crop production data (r = 0.96, relative RMSE = 37.0{\%}, p  {\textless}  0.05) from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The performance of estimated crop yields at a finer (field) scale was generally lower, but still meaningful (r = 0.42, relative RMSE = 50.8{\%}, p  {\textless}  0.05). Our methods and results are suitable for operational applications of crop yield monitoring at regional scales, suggesting the potential of using global satellite observations to improve agricultural management, policy decisions and regional/global food security.},

abstract = {Several geopolitical factors, aggravated by worries of global warming, have been fueling the search for and production of renewable energy worldwide for the past few years. Such demand for renewable energy is likely to benefit the sugarcane ethanol industry in Brazil, not only because sugarcane ethanol has a positive energetic balance and relatively low production costs, but also because Brazilian ethanol has been successfully produced and used as biofuel in the country since the 1970s. However, environmental and social impacts associated with ethanol production in Brazil can become important obstacles to sustainable biofuel production worldwide. Atmospheric pollution from burning of sugarcane for harvesting, degradation of soils and aquatic systems, and the exploitation of cane cutters are among the issues that deserve immediate attention from the Brazilian government and international societies. The expansion of sugarcane crops to the areas presently cultivated for soybeans also represent an environmental threat, because it may increase deforestation pressure from soybean crops in the Amazon region. In this paper, we discuss environmental and social issues linked to the expansion of sugarcane in Brazil for ethanol production, and we provide recommendations to help policy makers and the Brazilian government establish new initiatives to produce a code for ethanol production that is environmentally sustainable and economically fair. Recommendations include proper planning and environmental risk assessments for the expansion of sugarcane to new regions such as Central Brazil, improvement of land use practices to reduce soil erosion and nitrogen pollution, proper protection of streams and riparian ecosystems, banning of sugarcane burning practices, and fair working conditions for sugarcane cutters. We also support the creation of a more constructive approach for international stakeholders and trade organizations to promote sustainable development for biofuel production in developing countries such as Brazil. Finally, we support the inclusion of environmental values in the price of biofuels in order to discourage excessive replacement of natural ecosystems such as forests, wetlands, and pasture by bioenergy crops.},

abstract = {This study focuses on the differential hydrologic response of individual watersheds to climate warming within the Sierra Nevada mountain region of California. We describe climate warming models for 15 west-slope Sierra Nevada watersheds in California under unimpaired conditions using WEAP21, a weekly one-dimensional rainfall-runoff model. Incremental climate warming alternatives increase air temperature uniformly by 2 degrees, 4 degrees, and 6 degrees C, but leave other climatic variables unchanged from observed values. Results are analyzed for changes in mean annual flow, peak runoff timing, and duration of low flow conditions to highlight which watersheds are most resilient to climate warming within a region, and how individual watersheds may be affected by changes to runoff quantity and timing. Results are compared with current water resources development and ecosystem services in each watershed to gain insight into how regional climate warming may affect water supply, hydropower generation, and montane ecosystems. Overall, watersheds in the northern Sierra Nevada are most vulnerable to decreased mean annual flow, southern-central watersheds are most susceptible to runoff timing changes, and the central portion of the range is most affected by longer periods with low flow conditions. Modeling results suggest the American and Mokelumne Rivers are most vulnerable to all three metrics, and the Kern River is the most resilient, in part from the high elevations of the watershed. Our research seeks to bridge information gaps between climate change modeling and regional management planning, helping to incorporate climate change into the development of regional adaptation strategies for Sierra Nevada watersheds.},

Our findings demonstrate that, regardless of the AED dataset used, a log-logistic distribution most optimally fitted the ED time series. As such, in many regions across the terrestrial globe, the SEDI is insensitive to the AED method used for calculation, with the exception of winter months and boreal regions. The SEDI showed significant correlations (p {\textless} 0.05) with the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) across a wide range of regions, particularly for short ({\textless} 3-months) SPEI time-scales.

abstract = {Water relations during drought and xylem vulnerability to embolism were studied on four maize ( Zea mays L.) genotypes having contrasting grain yields under drought conditions. Drought provoked a drop in xylem pressure, leaf water potential and whole-plant transpiration. Transpiration was reduced to a minimum value when xylem pressures reached ca. -1.6 MPa. This value corresponded to the threshold xylem pressure below which xylem embolism developed to a substantial degree in leaf midribs. Therefore, xylem embolism always remained low in leaf veins, even when plants exhibited clear water-stress symptoms. This suggests that stomatal closure during drought contains xylem embolism to a minimum value. Cavitation resistance was not related to grain yield under drought conditions for the four genotypes evaluated. However, it can be speculated that an increase in cavitation resistance by cultural practices or genetic selection may increase drought survival in maize.},

framework to integrate biodiversity considerations in EIA. By defining
biodiversity in terms of composition, structure, and key processes,
and by describing the way in which human activities affect these
so-called components of biodiversity, it is possible to assess the
potential impacts of human activities on biodiversity. Furthermore,
the authors have translated this conceptual framework in generic
guidelines for screening and scoping in impact assessment. Countries
can use these generic guidelines to further operationalise the framework
within the existing national procedures for impact assessment. This
paper is fully coherent and partly overlapping with the guidelines

abstract = {Quantifying snowmelt-derived fluxes at the watershed scale within hillslope environments is critical for investigating local meadow scale groundwater dynamics in high elevation riparian ecosystems. In this article, we investigate the impact of snowmelt-derived groundwater flux from the surrounding hillslopes on water table dynamics in Tuolumne Meadows, which is located in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California, USA. Results show water levels within the meadow are controlled by a combination of fluxes at the hillslope boundaries, snowmelt within the meadow and changes in the stream stage. Observed water level fluctuations at the boundaries of the meadow show the hydrologic connection and subsequent disconnection between the hillslope and meadow aquifers. Timing of groundwater flux entering the meadow as a result of spring snowmelt can vary over 20 days based on the location, aspect, and local geology of the contributing area within the larger watershed. Identifying this temporal and spatial variability in flux entering the meadow is critical for simulating changes in water levels within the meadow. Model results can vary significantly based on the temporal and spatial scales at which watershed processes are linked to local processes within the meadow causing errors when boundary fluxes are lumped in time or space. Without a clear understanding of the surrounding hillslope hydrology, it is difficult to simulate groundwater dynamics within high elevation riparian ecosystems with the accuracy necessary for understanding ecosystem response.

annual rainfall. The season timescale was assessed using correlation
analysis between soil moisture and topographic indices. The event
timescale was studied by a quasi-continuous monitoring of rainfall,
soil moisture, runoff and piezometric levels. Results show that widespread
transfers of water along the hillslope are unusual because potential
conditions for producing overland flow or throughflow are spatially
discontinuous and extremely short-lived. During extreme events, runoff
coefficients may be locally high (ca. 40{\%} on slope lengths of 10
m), but decrease dramatically at the hillslope scale (Hillslopes
and alluvial fans function as runoff sources and sinks respectively.
Permanent aquifers are lacking in Rambla Honda. Variable proportions
of hillslope areas may contribute to flash floods in the main channel,
but their contribution to the formation of saturated layers within
the sediment fill is very limited.},

abstract = {The effects of climatic variability and change on Canadian agriculture have become an important research field since the early 1980s. In this paper, we seek to synthesize this research, focusing on agricultural adaptation, a purposeful proactive or reactive response to changes associated with climate, and influenced by many factors. A distinctive feature of methods used in research on adaptation in Canadian agriculture is the focus on the important role of human agency. Many individual farmers perceive they are well adapted to climate, because of their extensive 'technological' tool-kit, giving them confidence in dealing with climatic change. In many regions, little concern is expressed over climatic change, except where there are particular types of climatic vulnerability. Farmers respond to biophysical factors, including climate, as they interact with a complex of human factors. Several of these, notably institutional and political ones, have tended to diminish the farm-level risks stemming from climatic variability and change, but may well increase the long term vulnerability of Canadian agriculture. Notwithstanding the technological and management adaptation measures available to producers, Canadian agriculture remains vulnerable to climatic variability and to climate change.},

The colored noise filter formulation is extended to correct both time correlated and uncorrelated model error components. A more stable version of the separate filter without feedback is presented. The filters are implemented in an ensemble framework using Latin hypercube sampling. The techniques are illustrated on a simple one-dimensional groundwater problem. The results show that the presented filters outperform the standard Kalman filter and that the implementations with bias feedback work in ore general conditions than the implementations without feedback. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Howden2007,
abstract = {The strong trends in climate change already evident, the likelihood of further changes occurring, and the increasing scale of potential climate impacts give urgency to addressing agricultural adaptation more coherently. There are many potential adaptation options available for marginal change of existing agricultural systems, often variations of existing climate risk management. We show that implementation of these options is likely to have substantial benefits under moderate climate change for some cropping systems. However, there are limits to their effectiveness under more severe climate changes. Hence, more systemic changes in resource allocation need to be considered, such as targeted diversification of production systems and livelihoods. We argue that achieving increased adaptation action will necessitate integration of climate change-related issues with other risk factors, such as climate variability and market risk, and with other policy domains, such as sustainable development. Dealing with the many barriers to effective adaptation will require a comprehensive and dynamic policy approach covering a range of scales and issues, for example, from the understanding by farmers of change in risk profiles to the establishment of efficient markets that facilitate response strategies. Science, too, has to adapt. Multidisciplinary problems require multidisciplinary solutions, i.e., a focus on integrated rather than disciplinary science and a strengthening of the interface with decision makers. A crucial component of this approach is the implementation of adaptation assessment frameworks that are relevant, robust, and easily operated by all stakeholders, practitioners, policymakers, and scientists.},

abstract = {Catchment hydrological processes have been greatly influenced by the intensive variability in land use/cover, precipitation and air temperature due to climate change and local human activities. It is desired to understand catchment hydrological response to these changes. Observations show that annual runoff had a significant decreasing trend during the past 50years (1956-2005) in Haihe basin of northern China. In order to detect the major cause for this runoff decline, we first theoretically derived the elasticity of runoff from the Choudhury-Yang equation that is a water-energy balance equation based on the Budyko hypothesis. The elasticity of runoff was calculated in 33 selected mountainous catchments in Haihe basin based on their climate condition (represented by the aridity index, E0/P) and landscape condition (represented by the parameter, n). We analyzed the breakpoint of the annual runoff of the 33 catchments over the past 50years and split the whole study period into two sub-periods at the breakpoint (period 1: before the breakpoint; period 2: after the breakpoint). Then we attributed the runoff change between the two sub-periods to the impacts of climate variability and land use/cover change. The change of climate is represented by changes in precipitation (P) and potential evaporation (E0) and the change of land use/cover is represented by the parameter n in Choudhury-Yang equation. The change of annual runoff from period-1 to period-2 was the catchment hydrological response to the change of precipitation, potential evaporation and land use/cover (represented as $\delta$P, $\delta$E0and $\delta$n), and we calculated the runoff change based on the elasticities of runoff. For the 33 catchments, the mean annual runoff decreased by 43.0mm from the period-1 (91.4mm) to period-2 (48.4mm). Impacts of climate variation and land use/cover change were accountable for the runoff decrease by 26.9{\%} and 73.1{\%} on average, respectively. Impact of climate variation mainly came from the decrease in precipitation, and impact of land use/cover change mainly came from the vegetation increase. Vegetation increase was mainly due to the reforestation during the soil-water conservation practice during the past 30years and also partially due to climate variability especially the temperature increase. This methodology can also be used to predict the runoff change in these catchments without direct influence of local human activities under the future climate scenario based on the climate elasticity of runoff estimated from the historical hydroclimatic data. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

abstract = {Over the last 4 decades the use of blue water has received increasing attention in water resources research, but little attention has been paid to the quantification of green water in food production and food trade. In this paper, we estimate both the blue and green water components of consumptive water use (CWU) for a wide range of agricultural crops, including seven cereal crops, cassava, cotton, groundnuts, potatoes, pulses, rapeseed, soybeans, sugar beets, sugarcane, and sunflower, with a spatial resolution of 30 arc min on the land surface. The results show that the global CWU of these crops amounted to 3823 km3 a1 for the period 1998–2002. More than 80{\%} of this amount was from green water. Around 94{\%} of the world crop-related virtual water trade has its origin in green water, which generally constitutes a low-opportunity cost of green water as opposed to blue water. High levels of net virtual water import (NVWI) generally occur in countries with low CWU on a per capita basis, where a virtual water strategy is an attractive water management option to compensate for domestic water shortage for food production. NVWI is constrained by income; low-income countries generally have a low level of NVWI. Strengthening low-income countries economically will allow them to develop a virtual water strategy to mitigate malnutrition of their people.},

abstract = {Data were acquired by the Passive and Active Land S-band airborne sensor (PALS) during the 1999 Southern Great Plains (SGP99) experiment in Oklahoma to study remote sensing of soil moisture in vegetated terrain using low-frequency microwave radiometer and radar measurements. The PALS instrument measures radiometric brightness temperature and radar backscatter at L- and S-band frequencies with multiple polarizations and approximately equal spatial resolutions. The data acquired during SGP99 provide information on the sensitivities of multichannel low-frequency passive and active measurements to soil moisture for vegetation conditions including bare, pasture, and crop surface cover with field-averaged vegetation water contents mainly in the 0-2.5 kg m(-2) range. Precipitation occurring during the experiment provided an opportunity to observe wetting and drying surface conditions. Good correlations with soil moisture were observed in the radiometric channels. The 1.41-GHz horizontal-polarization channel showed the greatest sensitivity to soil moisture over the range of vegetation observed. For the fields sampled, a radiometric soil moisture retrieval accuracy of 2.3{\%} volumetric was obtained. The radar channels showed significant correlation with soil moisture for some individual fields, with greatest sensitivity at 1.26-GHz vertical copolarized channel. However, variability in vegetation cover degraded the radar correlations for the combined field data. Images generated from data collected on a sequence of flight lines over the watershed region showed similar patterns of soil moisture change in the radiometer and radar responses. This indicates that under vegetated conditions for which soil moisture estimates may not be feasible using current radar algorithms, the radar measurements nevertheless show a response to soil moisture change, and they can provide useful information on the spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture. An illustration of the change detection approach is given.},

abstract = {Recharge into granitic bedrock under a melting snowpack is being investigated as part of a study designed to understand hydrologic processes involving snow at Yosemite National Park in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. Snowpack mea- surements, accompanied by water content and matric potential measurements of the soil under the snowpack, allowed for esti- mates of infi ltration into the soil during snowmelt and percolation into the bedrock. During portions of the snowmelt period, infi ltration rates into the soil exceeded the permeability of the bedrock and caused ponding to be sustained at the soil–bedrock interface. During a 5-d period with little measured snowmelt, drainage of the ponded water into the underlying fractured gra- nitic bedrock was estimated to be 1.6 cm d−1, which is used as an estimate of bedrock permeability. T e numerical simulator TOUGH2 was used to reproduce the fi eld data and evaluate the potential for vertical fl ow into the fractured bedrock or lateral fl ow at the bedrock–soil interface. During most of the snowmelt season, the snowmelt rates were near or below the bedrock permeability. T e fi eld data and model results support the notion that snowmelt on the shallow soil overlying low permeability bedrock becomes direct infi ltration unless the snowmelt rate greatly exceeds the bedrock permeability. Late in the season, melt rates are double that of the bedrock permeability (although only for a few days) and may tend to move laterally at the soil–bed- rock interface downgradient and contribute directly to streamflow.},

abstract = {The micro-topography of a groundnut plot in Senegal has been recorded
over a full cultivation cycle, using an automated device able to
measure 16.2 m2 at every 5 cm with an accuracy of 1 mm. Tillage is
horse drawn, perpendicular to the general slope, and generates oriented
microreliefs. Surface Storage Capacity (SSC) was calculated on both
raw and slope-detrended surfaces. Additionally, various boundary
conditions (BC) were used: no-wall; three-wall (up, left and right);
or mirror (the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) surrounded by eight
alternately reversed images of itself). SSC is more affected by these
variants than by the variations of microrelief itself. Whatever the
calculation method, SSC (as well as random roughness), follows a
decreasing exponential with cumulated rainfall, but the coefficients
of the exponential differ widely to each other. This suggests that
SSC values could be of little use when they are obtained on various
slopes, arbitrarily detrended or not, and calculated with arbitrary
BC. We suggest a simple geometric model to characterise the way microrelief
empties as the slope increases. The model has two calibrated depth-ratio
parameters, one in each direction. It gives a more coherent framework
for calculation and use of SSC. The model was applied to one of the
DEMs of the data set, sampled after the first rain following hoeing.
With the mirror-BC and detrended slope, SSC was 3.6 mm. Microrelief
was found to behave in the same proportions, when tilted, than a
tetrahedral container 94 times wider than deeper in the tillage direction
and 11 times perpendicularly. This model represents the volume of
surface water that cannot flow in any direction. With three-wall-BC,
SSC was 6.7 mm, 1.4 mm remaining on the plot whatever the slope angle,
and 5.3 mm behaving the same as a container 69 times wider than deeper.
A possible use of this model is illustrated with an attempt to upscale
the sampled plot to the watershed to which it belongs.},

abstract = {We used an Optimal Interpolation (OI) scheme to generate a reference crop evapotranspiration (ETo) grid, forcing meteorological variables, and their respective error variance in the Iberian Peninsula for the period 1989–2011. To perform the OI we used observational data from the Spanish Meteorological Agency (AEMET) and outputs from a physically-based climate model. To compute ETo we used five OI schemes to generate grids for the five observed climate variables necessary to compute ETo using the FAO-recommended form of the Penman-Monteith equation (FAO-PM). The granularity of the resulting grids are less sensitive to variations in the density and distribution of the observational network than those generated by other interpolation methods. This is because our implementation of the OI method uses a physically-based climate model as prior background information about the spatial distribution of the climatic variables, which is critical for under-observed regions. This provides temporal consistency in the spatial variability of the climatic fields. We also show that increases in the density and improvements in the distribution of the observational network reduces substantially the uncertainty of the climatic and ETo estimates. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of observational uncertainties and network densification suggests the existence of a trade-off between quantity and quality of observations.},

abstract = {We examined the storage dynamics and isotopic composition of soil water over 12 months in three hydropedological units in order to understand runoff generation in a montane catchment. The units form classic catena sequences from freely draining podzols on steep upper hillslopes through peaty gleys in shallower lower slopes to deeper peats in the riparian zone. The peaty gleys and peats remained saturated throughout the year, while the podzols showed distinct wetting and drying cycles. In this region, most precipitation events are {\textless}10 mm in magnitude, and storm runoff is mainly generated from the peats and peaty gleys, with runoff coefficients (RCs) typically {\textless}10{\%}. In larger events the podzolic soils become strongly connected to the saturated areas, and RCs can exceed 40{\%}. Isotopic variations in precipitation are significantly damped in the organic-rich soil surface horizons due to mixing with larger volumes of stored water. This damping is accentuated in the deeper soil profile and groundwater. Consequently, the isotopic composition of stream water is also damped, but the dynamics strongly reflect those of the near-surface waters in the riparian peats. "pre-event" water typically accounts for {\textgreater}80{\%} of flow, even in large events, reflecting the displacement of water from the riparian soils that has been stored in the catchment for {\textgreater}2 years. These riparian areas are the key zone where different source waters mix. Our study is novel in showing that they act as "isostats," not only regulating the isotopic composition of stream water, but also integrating the transit time distribution for the catchment.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nKEY POINTS: Hillslope connectivity is controlled by small storage changes in soil unitsDifferent catchment source waters mix in large riparian wetland storageIsotopes show riparian wetlands set the catchment transit time distribution.},

abstract = {Global climate change impacts are already tracked in many physical and biological systems and they reveal a consistent picture of changes, e.g. an earlier onset of spring events in mid and higher latitudes and a lengthening of the plant growing season. However, available results are mainly based on the study of wild plants, whereas only a few studies have hinted at an earlier spring onset for agricultural plants. So far, no comprehensive study has compared phenological shifts between agricultural crops, fruit trees and wild plants. We analysed phenological time series of 93 phases in Germany (1951-2004) employing Bayesian nonparametric function estimation, and found that events related to the production of annual crops clearly differ from spring and summer events in wild plants and fruit trees. While non-farmer driven agricultural events and spring and summer growth stages of wild plants and fruit trees advanced (i.e. occurred earlier) by 4.4 to 7.1 d decade(-1), farming indicators, such as sowing and subsequent emergence of spring and winter crops, as well as harvesting, advanced by only 2.1 d decade(-1). The estimated functional behaviour and emergence of discontinuous changes are clearly different between the 2 groups. We conclude that phenological responses to temperature changes are only reflected in data of wild plants, fruit trees and those spring growth stages of winter crops and later growth stages of spring crops which are exclusively triggered by climate, while other changes due to agricultural production are subject to management practice alterations.},

The Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) has been shown to be sensitive to vegetation photosynthetic light use efficiency (LUE), GPP and canopy water-stress. Here, we use the NASA EOS MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) based PRI with eddy covariance CO2 flux measurements and meteorological observations from 20 tower sites representing major plant functional type (PFT) classes within the continental USA (CONUS) to assess GPP sensitivity to soil moisture related water stress. The sPRI (scaled PRI) metric derived using MODIS band 13 as a reference channel (sPRI13) shows generally higher correspondence with tower GPP estimates than other potential MODIS reference bands. The sPRI13 observations were used as a proxy for soil moisture related water supply constraints to LUE within a satellite data driven terrestrial carbon flux model to estimate GPP (GPPPRI). The GPPPRI calculations show generally favorable correspondence with tower GPP estimates (0.457≤R2≤0.818), except for lower GPPPRI performance over evergreen needleleaf forest (ENF) sites. A regional model sensitivity analysis using the sPRI13 as a water supply proxy indicated that water restrictions limit GPP over more than 21{\%} of the CONUS domain, particularly in drier climate areas where atmospheric moisture deficits (VPD) alone are insufficient to represent both atmosphere demand and water supply controls affecting productivity. Our results indicate strong potential of the MODIS sPRI13 to represent soil moisture related water supply controls influencing photosynthesis, with enhanced (1-km resolution) delineation of these processes closer to the scale of in situ tower observations. These observations may provide an effective tool for characterizing sub-grid spatial heterogeneity in soil moisture related controls that inform coarser scale observations and estimates determined from other satellite observations and earth system models.},

abstract = {The northern Idaho-Bitterroot batholith region is an exhumed, mid-crustal, plutonic-metamorphic complex that formed during crustal thickening and subsequent extension in the hinterland of the Cordilleran orogen. The relative timing of metamorphism, partial melting, intrusion, and deformation in this area may provide an analogue for magmatic and deformation processes active at mid-crustal depths in modern orogenic belts. Crustal thickening in this part of the Cordilleran began before 100 Ma, but the early stages of this process are poorly constrained. U-Pb zircon dates indicate that high-grade metamorphism was coincident with intrusion of syntectonic quartz diorite plutons at ca. 75-80 Ma, in the Bitterroot metamorphic core complex, where the deepest crustal levels are exposed. Metamorphic conditions reached ∼0.65-0.75 GPa and ∼600-750 °C in the northeastern part of the core complex. Upper amphibolite facies conditions caused widespread partial melting in quartzofeldspathic gneiss facilitated by muscovite breakdown in underlying semi-pelitic schist. New and previously published U-Pb zircon ages indicate that major partial melting of the lower and middle crust occurred between ca. 65 and 53 Ma, leading to the intrusion of the voluminous "main-phase" granitic plutons as thick (3-4 km) sills. Intrusion was accompanied by renewed upper amphibolite facies metamorphism and partial melting forming migmatites at ∼0.65 GPa pressure. The youngest mid-crustal granitic intrusions are about the same age as initial collapse of the orogen and extension at ca. 52-50 Ma. Extension was accommodated mainly on the Bitterroot mylonite zone that deforms the younger intrusions as well as the older high-grade rocks. Therefore, large-scale partial melting of the middle and lower crust followed crustal thickening by as much as 15-35 Ma, but pre-dated extension and exhumation by only 1-3 Ma. Collapse in this sector of the Cordilleran orogen appears to have been focussed where partial melting and plutonism were most intense and long-lived. Exhumation is revealed by the transition from amphibolite facies mylonitization, to greenschist-facies shearing, to brittle faulting, to inactivity of the shear zone that progressed from shallower crustal levels in the west to deeper crustal levels in the east from ca. 51-38 Ma, based on U-Pb and Ar-Ar results. Alkali-feldspar granites were emplaced during the onset of exhumation, but were intruded only into the shallowest Eocene crustal levels. Their generation may have been linked to decompression of the lithospheric column during crustal thinning. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Reliable assessments of how human activities will affect wildlife populations are essential for making scientifically defensible resource management decisions. A principle challenge of predicting effects of proposed management, development, or conservation actions is the need to incorporate multiple biotic and abiotic factors, including land-use and climate change, that interact to affect wildlife habitat and populations through time. Here we demonstrate how models of land-use, climate change, and other dynamic factors can be integrated into a coherent framework for predicting wildlife population trends. Our framework starts with land-use and climate change models developed for a region of interest. Vegetation changes through time under alternative future scenarios are predicted using an individual-based plant community model. These predictions are combined with spatially explicit animal habitat models to map changes in the distribution and quality of wildlife habitat expected under the various scenarios. Animal population responses to habitat changes and other factors are then projected using a flexible, individual-based animal population model. As an example application, we simulated animal population trends under three future land-use scenarios and four climate change scenarios in the Cascade Range of western Oregon. We chose two birds with contrasting habitat preferences for our simulations: winter wrens (Troglodytes troglodytes), which are most abundant in mature conifer forests, and song sparrows (Melospiza melodia), which prefer more open, shrubby habitats. We used climate and land-use predictions from previously published studies, as well as previously published predictions of vegetation responses using FORCLIM, an individual-based forest dynamics simulator. Vegetation predictions were integrated with other factors in PATCH, a spatially explicit, individual-based animal population simulator. Through incorporating effects of landscape history and limited dispersal, our framework predicted population changes that typically exceeded those expected based on changes in mean habitat suitability alone. Although land-use had greater impacts on habitat quality than did climate change in our simulations, we found that small changes in vital rates resulting from climate change or other stressors can have large consequences for population trajectories. The ability to integrate bottom-up demographic processes like these with top-down constraints imposed by climate and land-use in a dynamic modeling environment is a key advantage of our approach. The resulting framework should allow researchers to synthesize existing empirical evidence, and to explore complex interactions that are difficult or impossible to capture through piecemeal modeling approaches.

abstract = {A 10 year record of streamflow from the 8 ha Martinelli Basin in the Colorado Front Range is dominated by snowmelt-produced flows. During the main part of the May-September flow season, the flows developed a marked 24-h cycle which often accounts for more than 50{\%} of their variance, after removal of the seasonal trend. The amplitude and phase of this cycle vary in a similar fashion each year, showing a reduced amplitude and a forward phase shift as the summer progresses. These changes are explained by the reduction in the area of snow cover and its depth during the season. The phase shift may be used to estimate a catchment-scale hydraulic conductivity for a melting snow cover, yielding values in the range 40-80 cm h-1. These are consistent with other estimates based upon plot and laboratory studies. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

System description and operational constraints are specified using a new water resources engineering simulation language. A mixed integer linear programming solver efficiently routes water through the system network given the user-defined priorities or weights. Simulation cycles at different temporal scales allow for successive layering of constraints. The power and flexibility of the model is demonstrated by its ability to simulate the operation of complex new environmental water accounts.},

abstract = {There are pressing concerns about the interplay between agricultural productivity, water demand, and water availability in semi-arid to arid regions of the world. Currently, irrigated agriculture is the dominant water user in these regions and is estimated to consume approximately 80{\%} of the world's diverted freshwater resources. We develop an improved irrigated land-use mapping algorithm that uses the seasonal maximum value of a spectral index to distinguish between irrigated and non-irrigated parcels in Idaho's Snake River Plain. We compare this approach to two alternative algorithms that differentiate between irrigated and non-irrigated parcels using spectral index values at a single date or the area beneath spectral index trajectories for the duration of the agricultural growing season. Using six different pixel and county-scale error metrics, we evaluate the performance of these three algorithms across all possible combinations of two growing seasons (2002 and 2007), two datasets (MODIS and Landsat 5), and three spectral indices, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Enhanced Vegetation Index and Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDVI, EVI, and NDMI). We demonstrate that, on average, the seasonal-maximum algorithm yields an improvement in classification accuracy over the accepted single-date approach, and that the average improvement under this approach is a 60{\%} reduction in county scale root mean square error (RMSE), and modest improvements of overall accuracy in the pixel scale validation. The greater accuracy of the seasonal-maximum algorithm is primarily due to its ability to correctly classify non-irrigated lands in riparian and developed areas of the study region.},

From the data, the Brooks and Corey water retention parameters, soil water retention volumes at 0.33 bar and 15 bar, total porosity, and saturated conductivities for the major USDA soil textures classes were developed.

explore the possibility of inferring soil physical properties from
a multitemporal remotely sensed brightness temperature and soil moisture
maps. We construct two Artificial Neural Network models based on
physical linkages among space-time distribution of brightness temperature,
soil moisture, and soil media properties. Using a sequence of remotely
data from Washita '92 experiment, we show that it is possible to
infer soil texture from multitemporal brightness temperature and

abstract = {This article applies formal detection and attribution techniques to investigate the nature of observed shifts in the timing of streamflow in the western United States. Previous studies have shown that the snow hydrology of the western United States has changed in the second half of the twentieth century. Such changes manifest themselves in the form of more rain and less snow, in reductions in the snow water contents, and in earlier snowmelt and associated advances in streamflow "center'' timing (the day in the "water-year'' on average when half the water-year flow at a point has passed). However, with one exception over a more limited domain, no other study has attempted to formally attribute these changes to anthropogenic increases of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Using the observations together with a set of global climate model simulations and a hydrologic model (applied to three major hydrological regions of the western United States-the California region, the upper Colorado River basin, and the Columbia River basin), it is found that the observed trends toward earlier "center'' timing of snowmelt-driven streamflows in the western United States since 1950 are detectably different from natural variability (significant at the p {\textless} 0.05 level). Furthermore, the nonnatural parts of these changes can be attributed confidently to climate changes induced by anthropogenic greenhouse gases, aerosols, ozone, and land use. The signal from the Columbia dominates the analysis, and it is the only basin that showed a detectable signal when the analysis was performed on individual basins. It should be noted that although climate change is an important signal, other climatic processes have also contributed to the hydrologic variability of large basins in the western United States.},

The case of a linear dynamical system with linear measurements subject to a norm equality constraint is discussed with a review of existing solutions. The norm constraint introduces a nonlinearity in the system for which a new estimator structure is derived by minimizing a constrained cost function. It is shown that the constrained estimate is equivalent to the brute force normalization of the unconstrained estimate. The obtained solution is extended to nonlinear measurement models and applied to the spacecra attitude filtering problems.},

abstract = {Water relations during drought and xylem vulnerability to embolism were studied on four maize ( Zea mays L.) genotypes having contrasting grain yields under drought conditions. Drought provoked a drop in xylem pressure, leaf water potential and whole-plant transpiration. Transpiration was reduced to a minimum value when xylem pressures reached ca. -1.6 MPa. This value corresponded to the threshold xylem pressure below which xylem embolism developed to a substantial degree in leaf midribs. Therefore, xylem embolism always remained low in leaf veins, even when plants exhibited clear water-stress symptoms. This suggests that stomatal closure during drought contains xylem embolism to a minimum value. Cavitation resistance was not related to grain yield under drought conditions for the four genotypes evaluated. However, it can be speculated that an increase in cavitation resistance by cultural practices or genetic selection may increase drought survival in maize.},

abstract = {Soil profiles are often many meters deep, but with the majority of studies in soil microbiology focusing exclusively on the soil surface, we know very little about the nature of the microbial communities inhabiting the deeper soil horizons. We used phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis to examine the vertical distribution of specific microbial groups and to identify the patterns of microbial abundance and community-level diversity within the soil profile. Samples were collected from the soil surface down to 2m in depth from two unsaturated Mollisol profiles located near Santa Barbara, CA, USA. While the densities of microorganisms were generally one to two orders of magnitude lower in the deeper horizons of both profiles than at the soil surface, approximately 35{\%} of the total quantity of microbial biomass found in the top 2m of soil is found below a depth of 25cm. Principal components analysis of the PLFA signatures indicates that the composition of the soil microbial communities changes significantly with soil depth. The differentiation of microbial communities within the two profiles coincides with an overall decline in microbial diversity. The number of individual PLFAs detected in soil samples decreased by about a third from the soil surface down to 2m. The ratios of cyclopropyl/monoenoic precursors and total saturated/total monounsaturated fatty acids increased with soil depth, suggesting that the microbes inhabiting the deeper soil horizons are more carbon limited than surface-dwelling microbes. Using PLFAs as biomarkers, we show that Gram-positive bacteria and actinomycetes tended to increase in proportional abundance with increasing soil depth, while the abundances of Gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and protozoa were highest at the soil surface and substantially lower in the subsurface. The vertical distribution of these specific microbial groups can largely be attributed to the decline in carbon availability with soil depth.},

Soil CO2 flux during the 2002{\^{a}}2003 and 2003{\^{a}}2004 snow season averaged 0.31 and 0.35{\^{A}} {\^{A}}µmols {\^{A}} m-2{\^{A}} s-1 for the young and old forests respectively; similar to the relative difference observed during summer. There was a significant seasonal pattern of soil CO2 flux during the winter with fluxes averaging 0.22{\^{A}} {\^{A}}µmols {\^{A}} m-2{\^{A}} s-1 in December and January and increasing to an average of 0.61{\^{A}} {\^{A}}µmols {\^{A}} m-2{\^{A}} s-1 in May. Within-plot variability for measurements used in calculating flux was low. The coefficients of variation (CV) for CO2 concentration, snowpack density, and snow depth were 17, 8 and 14{\%}, respectively, yielding a CV for flux measurements within-plot of 29{\%}. A within plot CV of 29{\%} requires 8 sub-samples per plot to estimate the mean flux with a standard error of {\^{A}}±10{\%} of the mean. Variability in CO2 flux estimates among plots (size{\^{A}} ={\^{A}} 400{\^{A}} m2) was similar to that within plot and was also low (CV = {\~{}}28{\%}). With a CV of 28{\%} among plots, ten plots per treatment would have a 50{\%} probability of detecting a 25{\%} difference in treatment means for a{\^{A}} ={\^{A}} 0.05.


Soil CO2 flux can contribute as much as 60{\^{a}}80{\%} of total ecosystem respiration in forests. Although considerable research has focused on quantifying this flux during the growing season, comparatively little effort has focused on non-growing season fluxes. We measured soil CO2 efflux through snow in 50 and {\~{}}300{\^{A}} year old subalpine forest stands near Fraser CO. Our objectives were to quantify seasonal patterns in wintertime soil CO2 flux; determine if differences in soil CO2 flux between the two forest ages during the growing season persist during winter; and to quantify the sample size necessary to discern treatment differences. Soil CO2 flux during the 2002{\^{a}}2003 and 2003{\^{a}}2004 snow season averaged 0.31 and 0.35{\^{A}} {\^{A}}µmols {\^{A}} m-2{\^{A}} s-1 for the young and old forests respectively; similar to the relative difference observed during summer.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Daily stream flow and groundwater dynamics in forested subalpine catchments during spring are to a large extent controlled by hydrological processes that respond to the day-night energy cycle. Diurnal snowmelt and transpiration events combine to induce pressure variations in the soil water storage that are propagated to the stream. In headwater catchments these pressure variations can account for a significant amount of the total pressure in the system and control the magnitude, duration, and timing of stream inflow pulses at daily scales, especially in low flow systems. Changes in the radiative balance at the top of the snowpack can alter the diurnal hydrologic dynamics of the hillslope-stream system with potential ecological and management consequences. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} We present a detailed hourly dataset of atmospheric, hillslope, and streamflow measurements collected during one melt season from a semi-alpine headwater catchment in western Montana, US. We use this dataset to investigate the timing, pattern, and linkages among snowmelt-dominated hydrologic processes and assess the role of the snowpack, transpiration, and hillslopes in mediating daily movements of water from the top of the snowpack to local stream systems. We found that the amount of snowpack cold content accumulated during the night, which must be overcome every morning before snowmelt resumes, delayed water recharge inputs by up to 3 hours early in the melt season. These delays were further exacerbated by multi-day storms (cold fronts), which resulted in significant depletions in the soil and stream storages. We also found that both diurnal snowmelt and transpiration signals are present in the diurnal soil and stream storage fluctuations, although the individual contributions of these processes is difficult to discern. Our analysis showed that the hydrologic response of the snow-hillslope-stream system is highly sensitive to atmospheric drivers at hourly scales, and that variations in atmospheric energy inputs or other stresses are quickly transmitted and alter the intensity, duration and timing of snowmelt pulses and soil water extractions by vegetation, which ultimately drive variations in soil and stream water pressures.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Policymakers in arid and semiarid basins face hard choices on water policies needed for adaptation to climate change. Hydro-economic modeling is a state-of-the art approach that can be used to guide the design and implementation of these policies in basins. A major gap in developments of hydro-economic modeling to date has been the weak integration of physically-based representations of water sources and uses such as the interaction between ground and surface water resources, to inform complex basin scale policy choices. This paper presents an integrated hydro-economic modeling framework to address this gap with application to an important and complex river basin in Spain, the Jucar basin, for the assessment of a range of climate change scenarios and policy choices. Results indicate that in absence of adequate policies protecting water resources and natural ecosystems, water users will strategically deplete reservoirs, aquifers and river flows for short-term adaptation to climate change, disregarding the impacts on the environment and future human activities. These impacts can be addressed by implementing sustainable management policies. However, these policies could have disproportionate costs for some stakeholders groups, and their opposition may undermine attempts at sustainable policy. These tradeoffs among water policy choices are important guides to the design of policies aimed at basin-wide adaptation to climate change.},

abstract = {A trend of increasing streamflow has been observed in the Mississippi River (MR) basin since the 1940s as a result of increased precipitation. Herein we show that increasing MR flow is mainly in its baseflow as a result of land use change and accompanying agricultural activities that occurred in the MR basin during the last 60 years. Agricultural land use change in the MR basin has affected the basin-scale hydrology: more precipitation is being routed into streams as baseflow than stormflow since 1940s. We explain that the conversion of perennial vegetation to seasonal row crops, especially soybeans, in the basin since 1940s may have reduced evapotranspiration, increased groundwater recharge, and thus increased baseflow and streamflow. This explanation is supported with a data analysis of the annually and monthly flow rates at various river stations in the MR basin. Results from this study will help to direct our effort in managing land use and in reducing nutrient levels in MR and other major rivers since nutrient concentrations and loads carried by storm water and baseflow are different.},

abstract = {Cottonwoods are poplar trees that are well adapted to dynamic riparian, or streatmside, zones throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Here we assess the influences of three prominent physical disturbances, floods, fire, and ice, on cottonwood population ecology. We emphasize cottonwoods along rivers from the "Crown of the Continent", the central Rocky Mountain zone around the Canada - United States border, where five Populus species overlap and four hybridize. Moderate to major floods scour banks and deposit bars, creating barren and moist colonization sites that are essential for cottonwood seedling recruitment. Floods also scarify shallow roots, thus promoting clonal suckering, especially for the section Tacamahaca species: narrowleaf cottonwood (Populus angustifolia James), balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera L.), and black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa Torr. {\&} A. Gray). Fire would naturally be less frequent in some riparian zones because of the moist conditions and firebreaks provided by the streams, but with human use, floodplain forest fires have probably increased. Following fire, regrowth through clonal root and shoot suckers can be prolific for the Tacamahaca species, but is limited for the section Aigeiros, prairie cottonwood (Populus deltoides Bartr.). River ice, and especially ice drives that accompany winter or spring break-up, provide powerful riparian disturbances, that have often been neglected. Ice drives generate barren sites for seedling colonization, shear shoots, and scarify roots promoting shoot and root suckering, and sever branches, enabling dispersive clonal branch propagation. Following studies along many regional rivers, we conclude that: (i) riparian cottonwoods are tolerant of, and dependent upon, occasional physical disturbance for population rejuvenation; (ii) differing disturbance responses contribute to niche differentiation across the Populus species; (iii) different disturbances enable varied spatial and temporal patterns of cottonwood establishment, including fringe, general, and patch recruitment; and (iv) natural disturbance regimes probably favor native cottonwoods and disfavor some invasive, woody plants.

Fire would naturally be less frequent in some riparian zones because of the moist conditions and firebreaks provided by the streams, but with human use, floodplain forest fires have probably increased. Following fire, regrowth through clonal root and shoot suckers can be prolific for the Tacamahaca species, but is limited for the section Aigeiros, prairie cottonwood (Populus deltoides Bartr.).

Following studies along many regional rivers, we conclude that: (i) riparian cottonwoods are tolerant of, and dependent upon, occasional physical disturbance for population rejuvenation; (ii) differing disturbance responses contribute to niche differentiation across the Populus species; (iii) different disturbances enable varied spatial and temporal patterns of cottonwood establishment, including fringe, general, and patch recruitment; and (iv) natural disturbance regimes probably favor native cottonwoods and disfavor some invasive, woody plants.

Berrensiefen catchment is simulated with SWMS{\_}3D (three-dimensional
variably saturated flow based on finite elements) and a loosely coupled
model for the atmospheric boundary conditions. An additional model
component for macropore and surface runoff and their concentration
time is introduced. Time step of precipitation, atmospheric parameters
and the simulated hydrologic processes is one hour. Soil parameters
are discretized with a horizontal resolution of 10 m and five nodal
layers in the vertical direction. A high resolution digital elevation
model is used to reconstruct catchment surface morphology.For a nearly
2-month period hydrologic processes are simulated. The process model
results are compared with measurements and the influence of the topography,
the distributed soil and land use parameters on the soil water fluxes
is examined.The spatial structure of soil moisture during a drying
period is analysed using geostatistics. The application of standard
geostatistical techniques (variogram modelling) captures the main
features of spatial variability of the modelled soil moisture distributions.
The integral scale or correlation length of soil moisture is constant
while the semivariance shows clear correlation with soil moisture
status during that period.A geostatistical comparison of the modelled
soil moisture patterns of the whole catchment with a measured data
set of a single hillslope of the catchment addresses the problem
of differing scales of modelling and measurements. It is shown that
due to the different spatial scales the results of point measurements
of soil moisture can hardly be used to validate the modelled spatial
structure of soil moisture.},

abstract = {This article provides a fundamental theoretical basis for understanding EnKF and serves as a useful text for future users. Data assimilation and parameter-estimation problems are explained, and the concept of joint parameter and state estimation, which can be solved using ensemble methods, is presented. KF and EKF are briefly discussed before introducing and deriving EnKF. Similarities and differences between KF and EnKF are pointed out. The benefits of using EnKF with high-dimensional and highly nonlinear dynamical models are illustrated by examples. EnKF and EnKS are also derived from Bayes theorem, using a probabilistic approach. The derivation is based on the assumption that measurement errors are independent in time and the model represents a Markov process, which allows for Bayes theorem to be written in a recursive form, where measurements are processed sequentially in time. The practical implementation of the analysis scheme isdiscussed, and it is shown that it can be computed efficiently in the space spanned by the ensemble realizations. The square root scheme is discussed as an alternative method that avoids the perturbation of measurements. However, the square root scheme has other pitfalls, and it is recommended to use the symmetric square root with or without a random rotation. The random rotation introduces a stochastic component to the update, and the quality of the scheme may then not improve compared to the original stochastic EnKF scheme with perturbed measurements.},

abstract = {Soil moisture is a fundamental data source used by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) International Production Assessment Division (IPAD) to monitor crop growth stage and condition and subsequently, globally forecast agricultural yields. Currently, the USDA IPAD estimates surface and root-zone soil moisture using a two-layer modified Palmer soil moisture model forced by global precipitation and temperature measurements. However, this approach suffers from well-known errors arising from uncertainty in model forcing data and highly simplified model physics. Here, we attempt to correct for these errors by designing and applying an Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) data assimilation system to integrate surface soil moisture retrievals from the NASA Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) into the USDA modified Palmer soil moisture model. An assessment of soil moisture analysis products produced from this assimilation has been completed for a five-year (2002 to 2007) period over the North American continent between 23{\^{A}}° N-50{\^{A}}° N and 128{\^{A}}° W-65{\^{A}}° W. In particular, a data denial experimental approach is utilized to isolate the added utility of integrating remotely sensed soil moisture by comparing EnKF soil moisture results obtained using (relatively) low-quality precipitation products obtained from real-time satellite imagery to baseline Palmer model runs forced with higher quality rainfall. An analysis of root-zone anomalies for each model simulation suggests that the assimilation of AMSR-E surface soil moisture retrievals can add significant value to USDA root-zone predictions derived from real-time satellite precipitation products.},

abstract = {Rapidly developing coastal regions face consequences of land use and climate change including flooding and increased sediment, nutrient, and chemical runoff, but these forces may also enhance pathogen runoff, which threatens human, animal, and ecosystem health. Using the zoonotic parasite Toxoplasma gondii in California, USA as a model for coastal pathogen pollution, we examine the spatial distribution of parasite runoff and the impacts of precipitation and development on projected pathogen delivery to the ocean. Oocysts, the extremely hardy free-living environmental stage of T. gondii shed in faeces of domestic and wild felids, are carried to the ocean by freshwater runoff. Linking spatial pathogen loading and transport models, we show that watersheds with the highest levels of oocyst runoff align closely with regions of increased sentinel marine mammal T. gondii infection. These watersheds are characterized by higher levels of coastal development and larger domestic cat populations. Increases in coastal development and precipitation independently raised oocyst delivery to the ocean (average increases of 44{\%} and 79{\%}, respectively), but dramatically increased parasite runoff when combined (175{\%} average increase). Anthropogenic changes in landscapes and climate can accelerate runoff of diverse pathogens from terrestrial to aquatic environments, influencing transmission to people, domestic animals, and wildlife.},

abstract = {Modelling the hydrologic processes of semiarid basins is specially challenging due to the specific characteristics of this type of environment. The discontinuity of the processes both in space and in time produces a highly complicated rainfall-runoff relationship. Runoff production and reinfiltration areas produce a discontinuous spatial pattern of runoff; channel flow is ephemeral and restricted to the wet season of the year or to heavy rainfalls, and many local saturated layers of soil separated by unsaturated areas can occur. The hydrological connection of the different parts of the basin produces a nonlinear and complex hydrologic behaviour because different response mechanisms of the basin are triggered as the hydrological connectivity increases. Similarly, as connectivity decreases, so does the information arriving at the monitored state variables used to calibrate the model and to understand the system. This paper describes the application of a distributed hydrologic model to describe the hydrologic behaviour of a small semiarid basin including surface and subsurface processes. The model is parameterized and calibrated to simulate a period of 71 days covering the transition of the basin from a dry to a wet state, during which most of the hydrologic processes of the basin are activated. The calibration strategy used different sources and types of information on the state of the basin and an efficient gradient based search algorithm to find the optimal values of the most sensitive parameters. The modelled hydrograph and the modelled internal description of the basin were analysed in the light of its known behaviour and the existing knowledge of semiarid hydrology reported in the literature. The results indicate that while the integrated behaviour of the basin represented by the output hydrograph can be well reproduced, the subsurface processes and the internal dynamics of the basin are less accurately simulated, mainly due to the lack of information on the geometry of the subsurface domain (soil depths and bedrock topography) and on the spatial distribution of the parameters.

abstract = {The objectives of this study were to investigate water, ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), and nitrate nitrogen (NO3−-N) export processes during the thawing period in a watershed with heavy agricultural activities and to evaluate contributions of N (i.e., NO3−-N and NH4+-N) from different source areas under different climate conditions. Experiments were conducted within the 75km2 agricultural Heidingzi watershed in northeast China. The thawing period was divided into four stages: early-melt, late-melt, rain-on-melt, and post-melt. Drainage regions (DRs) were separated into three types. The processes of water and N discharge from soil into rivers were monitored in these DRs during the thawing periods of 2014, 2015, and 2016. Results show that the processes of water and N discharge were not synchronous during the thawing period. Variations in discharge concentrations of NH4+-N and NO3−-N during the thawing period were mainly affected by the flushing effect, which was controlled by the physical state of the surface water (snow or ice) and the melt rate of frozen soil. Contributions of N export from the DRs varied under different land uses and climate conditions during the thawing period. NO3−-N export was mainly from maize fields. Thawing stages with high NO3−-N export were always accompanied by higher discharge rates. NH4+-N export mainly occurred during the early-melt and late-melt stages and from riverside rural regions.},

abstract = {In recent years there has been a dramatic increase in the demand for timely, comprehensive global agricultural intelligence. Timely information on global crop production is indispensable for combating the growing stress on the world's crop production and for securing both short-term and long-term stable and reliable supply of food. Global agriculture monitoring systems are critical to providing this kind of intelligence and global earth observations are an essential component of an effective global agricultural monitoring system as they offer timely, objective, global information on croplands distribution, crop development and conditions as the growing season progresses. The Global Agriculture Monitoring Project (GLAM), a joint NASA, USDA, UMD and SDSU initiative, has built a global agricultural monitoring system that provides the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) with timely, easily accessible, scientifically-validated remotely-sensed data and derived products as well as data analysis tools, for 
crop-condition monitoring and production assessment. This system is an integral component of the USDA's FAS Decision Support System (DSS) for agriculture. It has significantly improved the FAS crop analysts' ability to monitor crop conditions, and to quantitatively forecast crop yields through the provision of timely, high-quality global earth observations data in a format customized for FAS alongside a suite of data analysis tools. FAS crop analysts use these satellite data in a ‘convergence of evidence' approach with meteorological data, field reports, crop models, attach{\'{e}} reports and local reports. The USDA FAS is currently the only operational provider of timely, objective crop production forecasts at the global scale. These forecasts are routinely used by the other US Federal government agencies as well as by commodity trading companies, farmers, relief agencies and foreign governments. This paper discusses the operational components and new developments of the},

abstract = {The complex interactions between plants, soils, and climates in semiarid ecosystems make it difficult to define specific ecohydrological optimization mechanisms that underlie observed spatiotemporal patterns of vegetation structure. There remains a clear need to develop conceptual models that are capable of interpreting and predicting spatial pattern formation in savannas (and similar dry woodland ecosystems), as well as metrics for assessing optimization or organization of patterns, as one scales from individual canopies to landscapes and beyond. In this article, we propose a unifying hypothesis regarding ecohydrological optimization of pattern and processes, namely, that vegetation patterns in water-limited environments are constrained in their ability to maximize water use by a need to simultaneously minimize water stress. We use this trade-off-based hypothesis to infer the function of dryland ecosystems under a wide range of scales and applications. Specifically, we examine spatial and temporal aspects of ecohydrological organization of vegetation patterns for three different cases: (1) patterns of regional-scale temporal organization across a regional climate gradient, (2) patterns of landscape-scale spatial organization within a semiarid drainage basin, and (3) patterns of individual-scale structural organization across varying soil textures. Although the insight gained from each of these examples is derived from specific modeling approaches, each of which contains its own unique set of assumptions and limitations, they are unified by our proposed ecohydrological trade-off approach that simultaneously considers both plant water deficit and plant water use as a diagnostic tool for assessing vegetation patterns in water-limited environments. It is our hope that the ongoing development of coupled ecological and hydrological models capable of assessing a diversity of interactions between plants, soils, and climates will lead to the emergence of more generalized hypotheses regarding the manner by which ecological and hydrological patterns coorganize in landscapes.},

abstract = {Spring temperatures strongly influence plant phenology, including budburst, canopy development, and crop planting period. Recent spring warming coincides with earlier and longer non-frozen season trends, and generally earlier spring canopy onset and vegetation productivity increases over the conterminous US (CONUS). However, earlier spring onset increases frost damage risk, with potential negative impacts to productivity. Frost sensitivity and vulnerability is heterogeneous over the CONUS domain, while the occurrence, intensity and regional impact of frost events are difficult to monitor from sparse weather stations. To enhance regional frost risk monitoring capabilities, we developed spring frost day (SFD) and spring frost damage day (SFDD) metrics spanning a long-term ({\textgreater}30 year) record by integrating a satellite microwave remote sensing record of daily landscape freeze-thaw (FT) status and optical-IR sensor based phenology record of start of season (SOS) and day of peak (DOP) canopy cover. We find a decreasing regional SFD trend (-1.6 days decade-1; p{\textless}0.1) coincident with spring warming, while the SFDD is generally increasing (1.5 days decade-1; p{\textless}0.1). Spring warming is reducing frost occurrence, but an earlier SOS trend is paradoxically increasing vegetation frost damage risk. The ecological significance of the SFD and SFDD changes were evaluated using satellite derived vegetation gross primary production (GPP) and vegetation greenness (EVI2) anomalies. Higher SFD and SFDD levels coincide with reduced vegetation growth in spring, but only the SFDD shows significant (p{\textless}0.1) correlation with EVI2 summer growth anomalies. Apparent vegetation sensitivity to the SFDD varies across regional biomes and elevation zones, while an increasing SFDD trend indicates potentially larger negative impacts on regional vegetation growth with continued warming. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Evapotranspiration (ET) is the largest term after precipitation in terrestrial water budgets. Accurate estimates of ET are needed for numerous agricultural and natural resource management tasks and to project changes in hydrological cycles due to potential climate change. We explore recent methods that combine vegetation indices (VI) from satellites with ground measurements of actual ET (ETa) and meteorological data to project ETa over a wide range of biome types and scales of measurement, from local to global estimates. The majority of these use time-series imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer on the Terra satellite to project ET over seasons and years. The review explores the theoretical basis for the methods, the types of ancillary data needed, and their accuracy and limitations. Coefficients of determination between modeled ETa and measured ETa are in the range of 0.45–0.95, and root mean square errors are in the range of 10–30{\%} of mean ETa values across biomes, similar to methods that use thermal infrared bands to estimate ETa and within the range of accuracy of the ground measurements by which they are calibrated or validated. The advent of frequent-return satellites such as Terra and planed replacement platforms, and the increasing number of moisture and carbon flux tower sites over the globe, have made these methods feasible. Examples of operational algorithms for ET in agricultural and natural ecosystems are presented. The goal of the review is to enable potential end-users from different disciplines to adapt these methods to new applications that require spatially-distributed ET estimates.},

abstract = {During experiments aimed at understanding the mechanisms by which long-chain carbon molecules are formed in interstellar space and circumstellar shells1, graphite has been vaporized by laser irradiation, producing a remarkably stable cluster consisting of 60 carbon atoms. Concerning the question of what kind of 60-carbon atom structure might give rise to a superstable species, we suggest a truncated icosahedron, a polygon with 60 vertices and 32 faces, 12 of which are pentagonal and 20 hexagonal. This object is commonly encountered as the football shown in Fig. 1. The C60 molecule which results when a carbon atom is placed at each vertex of this structure has all valences satisfied by two single bonds and one double bond, has many resonance structures, and appears to be aromatic.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: A stochastic weather generator is a model capable of generating daily weather patterns that are statistically similar to the observed patterns. Weather generators are commonly used in climate change studies as a computationally inexpensive tool to generate high resolution climate change scenarios based on the output from global climate models. Considering that the frequency and the magnitude of extreme weather events are likely to increase under climate change, there is a growing need to investigate how well weather extremes are simulated by weather generators. The aim of this study was to test the skill of the LARS-WG stochastic weather generator to simulate extreme weather events at 20 locations with diverse climates. Yearly maxima of daily precipitation, maximum temperature and length of heat waves, and their 10 and 20 yr return values were compared for observed and synthetic data by fitting the generalized extreme value distribution and computing confidence intervals. Means of yearly maxima and return values of daily synthetic precipitation were within the 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI95) of observed data for all sites. Daily maximum temperature extremes were reproduced less accurately. Although the root mean squared error (RMSE) calculated for the means of maxima of maximum temperature was {\textless}1°C, synthetic means for approximately half of the sites were outside the CI95 for observed values. This indicates that the assumption used in LARS-WG, that daily temperature could be approximated by the normal distribution, is inadequate. Means of yearly maxima for length of heat waves and 10 and 20 yr return values were within the CI95 for all sites except 3. For those sites where LARS-WG performance was inadequate, daily maximum temperature was not normally distributed but was skewed.},

abstract = {Groundwater is an important resource. In many developed basins it meets part or all of the water demands. In addition, the management of groundwater resources directly impacts stream flows through stream-aquifer interactions. Yet many reservoir system analysis models that are used for the management of surface water resources either include a simplified representation of the groundwater flow dynamics or rely on surrogate models (linear response functions, artificial neural networks, etc.) which are trained using more complex groundwater models. These approaches may introduce restrictive, sometimes inaccurate, representation of the groundwater flow dynamics and additional modeling steps. In this study a reservoir system analysis model that utilizes an LP solver is linked directly to a non-linear, three-dimensional, finite element groundwater model. The linked model is a general-purpose model and can be applied to any basin. Some of the features of the linked model are showcased by an application to California's Central Valley.},

abstract = {There are several techniques for junction profiling available in literature, yet none of them are practically suitable for the accurate determination of the lateral junction steepness in TFET devices, which is the most important parameter influencing TFET performance. In this work, a simple physics-based compact analytical model has been developed for the junction steepness as a function of the doping concentration and the maximum electric field at the junction. Using the underlying physics, we report a novel yet simple method to estimate the lateral junction steepness using only the I-V measurements on a p+-i- n+ tunnel diode test structure fabricated on the same wafer as the TFET with common process steps. Assuming that doping concentration, Si thin-film thickness, and buried-oxide thickness are known from the fabrication process, this algorithm uses the maximum electric field extracted from the I-V measurements and applies the analytical model to estimate the junction steepness. It has been observed that the estimations based on this method have a maximum deviation of sub-0.2 nm/decade from the actual junction steepness of the investigated devices.},

abstract = {We analysed the evolution of drought on the NW Iberian Peninsula from 1930 to 2006, and identified differences between the effects of precipitation variability and warming processes on drought severity and surface water resources. Two drought indices were used, one based on precipitation (the standardised precipitation index, SPI) and the other based on water balance, as reflected by the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, PET (the standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index, SPEI). The results show that precipitation has increased in the region, but a significant increase has also occurred in PET. No statistically significant differences were found over the study period for the severity of drought, as assessed by both the SPI and SPEI. In addition, although in the last 3 decades the mean duration of drought episodes has increased by approximately 1 mo as a consequence of the increase of the PET rates, the differences are not statistically significant. River discharge is mainly driven by precipitation variability, whereas warming processes did not have a noticeable influence on the streamflow variability between 1930 and 2006. The implications of global warming projected by global climate models on future drought severity and the availability of water resources are highly relevant in the near future. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2011.},

abstract = {Soil surface CO2 flux (Fs) is the dominant respiratory flux in many temperate forest ecosystems. Snowpacks increase this dominance by insulating the soil against the low temperature to which aboveground components are exposed. However, measurement of Fs in winter may be impeded by snow cover. Likewise, developing annual Fs models is complicated by seasonal variation in root and microbial metabolism. We compared three methods of measuring sub-snow Fs: (1) dynamic chamber measurements at the upper snowpack surface (Fsnow), (2) dynamic chamber measurements at the soil surface via snowpits (Fsoil), and (3) static estimates based on measured concentrations of carbon dioxide ([CO2]) and conductance properties of the snowpack (Fdiffusional). Methods were compared at a mid-elevation forest in northeastern Washington, a mid-elevation forest in northern Idaho, and a high-elevation forest and neighboring meadow in Wyoming. The methods that minimized snowpack disturbance, Fdiffusional and Fsnow, yielded similar estimates of Fs. In contrast, Fsoil yielded rates two to three times higher than Fsnow at the forested sites, and seven times higher at the subalpine meadow. The ratio Fsoil/Fsnow increased with increasing snow depth when compared across all sites. Snow removal appears to induce elevated soil flux as a result of lateral CO2 diffusion into the pit. We chose Fsnow as our preferred method and used it to estimate annual CO2 fluxes. The snowpack was present for 36{\%} of the year at this site, during which time 132 g C m-2, or 17{\%} of the annual flux, occurred. We conclude that snowpack CO2 flux is quantitatively important in annual carbon budgets for these forests and that the static and dynamic methods yield similar and reasonable estimates of the flux, as long as snowpack disturbance is minimized.},

abstract = {We calibrated an integrated flow–tracer model to simulate spatially distributed isotope time series in stream water in a 7.9-km 2 catchment with an urban area of 13{\%}. The model used flux tracking to estimate the time-varying age of stream water at the outlet and both urbanized (1.7 km 2) and non-urban (4.5 km 2) sub-catchments over a 2.5-year period. This included extended wet and dry spells where precipitation equated to {\textgreater}10-year return periods. Modelling indicated that stream water draining the most urbanized tributary was youngest with a mean transit time (MTT) of 171 days compared with 456 days in the non-urban tributary. For the larger catchment, the MTT was 280 days. Here, the response of urban contributing areas dominated smaller and more moderate runoff events, but rural contributions dominated during the wettest periods, giving a bi-modal distribution of water ages. Whilst the approach needs refining for sub-daily time steps, it provides a basis for projecting the effects of urbanization on stream water transit times and their spatial aggregation. This offers a novel approach for understanding the cumulative impacts of urbanization on stream water quantity and quality, which can contribute to more sustainable management.},

abstract = {Plantation forestry is an increasingly important land use in Australia. While plantations can present significant environmental benefits such as salinity and erosion controls, their impact on streamflow needs to be recognized. This study evaluated the impacts of plantation and climate variability on streamflow from catchments in Australia. In total 15 catchments were selected based on the availability of streamflow, meteorological, and plantation information. The catchment areas range from 0.6 to 1136 km(2) and represent different climatic conditions and management practices. The Mann-Kendall test was used to estimate trends in the annual streamflow, rainfall, potential evaporation, and runoff ratio. The plantation effect on streamflow was determined with the time-trend analysis method, while the effect of climate variability was calculated using the sensitivity-based approach. All the selected catchments showed reductions in annual streamflow and runoff ratio over the period of the records. The results indicate that plantation expansions accounted for 28{\%} to 106{\%} of the observed total streamflow reductions, while climate variability was responsible for 5{\%} to 80{\%} of the total streamflow reductions. It is evident that both plantation expansions and climate variability contributed to the observed streamflow reductions. In most of the catchments, the effect of plantation expansion on streamflow was more important than that of climate variability and is likely to have exacerbated the effect of climate variability on streamflow. Plantation expansions can reduce streamflow from both small and large catchments as this study demonstrated and the relative streamflow reduction can be linearly related to percentage plantation area in a catchment.},

abstract = {The rates at which lands in the United States were cleared for agriculture, abandoned, harvested for wood, and burned were reconstructed from historical data for the period 1700-1990 and used in a terrestrial carbon model to calculate annual changes in the amount of carbon stored in terrestrial ecosystems, including wood products. Changes in land use released 27 +/- 6 petagrams of carbon to the atmosphere before 1945 and accumulated 2 +/- 2 petagrams of carbon after 1945, largely as a result of fire suppression and forest growth on abandoned farmlands. During the 1980s, the net flux of carbon attributable to land management offset 10 to 30 percent of U.S. fossil fuel emissions.},

abstract = {Successful regeneration of holm oaks is essential for the maintenance
of biological diversity in the dehesas of Central Spain. In order
to explore land-use and ecological site determinants of holm oak
regeneration, we conducted a survey of oak recruitment and regeneration,
physical features, and grazing impact indicators through a variety
of sampling methods. Juvenile and sapling abundance was alarmingly
low (51.2+/-69.1 and 85.0+/-85.2 plants ha-1), but varied considerably
within and across study sites. Statistical analysis of spatial distribution
of juveniles and saplings showed that they were highly clumped (tN=0.64
and 0.61), while mature trees were dispersed uniformly (tN=0.38).
The clumping of juveniles and saplings results from the tendency
for regeneration to occur on safe microsites protected from browsing
and radiation (shrubs and next to rock outcrops) or from the capacity
of ramets to grow vegetatively underneath canopies. We developed
indicators for grazing pressure, but none of these showed any relationship
with vegetation variables. Crop cultivated dehesas had lower mature
tree densities (18.9+/-13.9 trees ha-1) than grazed (38.6+/-18.1
trees ha-1) and shrubby (56.4+/-27.5 trees ha-1) dehesas,
indicating potentially negative consequences of cultivation on holm
oak demography. Abundant oak regeneration was correlated with mature
tree density and size, with woody vegetation cover, and with physical
features such as slope, rock cover, and paddock extent. These results
suggest that holm oak regeneration in dehesas is controlled by physiognomic
features and long-term human impacts rather than directly by current
grazing levels.},
